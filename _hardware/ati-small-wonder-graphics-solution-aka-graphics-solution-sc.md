In the mid-1980s, the IBM PC graphics landscape was fragmented. You had **CGA** for colour, **Hercules** for sharp monochrome, **MDA** for text, and by 1984–85, **EGA** was entering the scene. For PC users, it wasn’t always clear which card to buy — or which monitor they’d be stuck with.  

ATI (founded in 1985) entered this market with one of its first commercial graphics cards: the **ATI Small Wonder Graphics Solution**. Despite its humble name, this card was anything but small in ambition. It provided broad compatibility in a single package, cementing ATI’s reputation as a company that could do more than just clone IBM’s designs.  


### Features and Capabilities  

- **CGA compatibility** – Runs IBM’s standard CGA graphics and text modes.  
- **MDA and Hercules emulation** – Supports monochrome text and high-resolution graphics modes.  
- **CGA-on-MDA grayscale emulation** – Like its later sibling, the Graphics Solution SR, the Small Wonder could display colour CGA games on a monochrome monitor in grayscale tones.  
- **Bus interface** – Standard 8-bit ISA, compatible with the IBM PC, XT, and early AT systems.  
- **Monitor flexibility** – Works with both monochrome and colour displays.  


### Why It Mattered  

The Small Wonder wasn’t the first multi-standard graphics card, but it was one of the most **affordable and practical** solutions of its day. For users of systems that shipped with only a monochrome monitor, this meant:  

- **Productivity during the day** (Hercules and MDA for spreadsheets, word processors, CAD).  
- **Games in the evening** (CGA-on-MDA, albeit with flicker due to interlacing).  

This dual-purpose ability gave the Small Wonder real staying power in offices and homes alike.  


### Technical Details  

The card’s operation was controlled via **DIP switches** that let you choose between colour and mono modes.  

- **CGA Emulation:** Switches set to emulate colour output.  
- **Hercules Mode:** Switches set for high-resolution mono graphics.  
- **CGA-on-MDA Mode:** Switches configured to map CGA colour into grayscale tones on a mono monitor.  

Like the later Graphics Solution SR, the CGA-on-MDA trick was both ingenious and flawed: it introduced **interlace flicker**, but it made games playable on displays that would otherwise be useless for them.  


### Small Wonder vs. Graphics Solution SR  

The **Small Wonder Graphics Solution** and the **Graphics Solution SR** share many traits, but there are differences worth noting:  

- **Small Wonder GS:** Earlier release, simpler design, and ATI’s first big step into the PC graphics market.  
- **Graphics Solution SR:** A refinement of the same idea, with more polished emulation modes and better documentation.  

In practice, both cards solved the same problem — giving MDA/Hercules users access to CGA games — but the SR is generally seen as the more mature and stable product.  


### Legacy  

The **ATI Small Wonder Graphics Solution** was one of ATI’s earliest forays into PC graphics, and it set the stage for the company’s later success. By providing compatibility, flexibility, and practical value, ATI quickly carved out a space in a crowded market.  

ATI would go on to refine the Small Wonder line, eventually replacing it with the **EGA Wonder** and **VGA Wonder** families — cards that gained widespread adoption and cemented ATI as a major player in the graphics industry.  


### Final Thoughts  

The Small Wonder Graphics Solution is a fascinating piece of retro hardware. It wasn’t the most powerful graphics card of its era, but it solved a very real problem for early PC owners — and it introduced ATI to the world as more than just a clone manufacturer.  

For collectors and enthusiasts today, the Small Wonder represents the **roots of ATI’s graphics empire**, long before Radeon and AMD came into the picture.
