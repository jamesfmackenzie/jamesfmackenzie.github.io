I received my first Atari ST in **1989**; a surplus unit from my father's business. It was a luxury (at the time!) **1 MB model — the Atari 1040STFM**, complete with the Professional software pack.

Hooked up to a colour television, I was instantly captivated by the lime-green GEM desktop. I had never used a computer mouse before, and it felt like a huge leap forward from the command-line and keyboard-driven worlds of the ZX Spectrum and the school BBC Micro.

After eagerly clicking through every bundled disk, I was — only very slightly — disappointed to find relatively few games included.

Fortunately, a friend owned the more gaming-oriented **Atari ST Power Pack**, and before long I was borrowing disks and discovering just how strong the ST’s arcade conversions could be:

- Afterburner  
- Black Lamp  
- Bomb Jack  
- Bombuzal  
- Double Dragon  
- Eliminator  
- Gauntlet II  
- Nebulus  
- OutRun  
- Overlander  
- Pac-Mania  
- Predator  
- R-Type  
- Space Harrier  
- Star Goose  
- Star Ray  
- Starglider  
- Super Hang-On  
- Super Huey  
- Xenon  

I continued using the ST well into the 1990s, maintaining a subscription to the venerable **ST Format** magazine — watching it slowly shrink as the platform’s commercial influence waned.

Eventually (like almost everyone else), I moved on to the PC. But those formative years with the Atari ST never really left me.


### The Atari ST in Context

The **Atari ST** line was introduced in **1985** as Atari Corporation’s 16-bit successor to its hugely successful 8-bit home computers. The first model, the **520ST**, appeared in limited quantities in mid-1985, with wider availability later that year.

The ST was groundbreaking in several key ways. It was the **first mass-market personal computer to ship with a bitmapped colour graphical user interface**, using Digital Research’s **GEM** desktop environment running on top of **TOS** (The Operating System), which itself was derived from CP/M concepts.

Powered by a **Motorola 68000 CPU running at 8 MHz**, the ST offered a clean, flat 24-bit address space and performance that compared very favourably with contemporaries — including early IBM PC compatibles and even Apple’s Macintosh, at a significantly lower price.


### The Atari 1040STFM

Released in **1986**, the **Atari 1040ST** was a landmark machine. With **1 MB of RAM as standard**, it became the **first home computer to break the US$1-per-kilobyte memory barrier**, an extraordinary achievement at the time.

The **STFM** variant added:
- An **internal floppy drive**
- **RF and composite video output** for use with televisions
- Stereo sound output via RCA jacks

This made it especially popular in home environments, where dedicated monitors were still considered a luxury.


### Technical Overview

| Component | Details |
|---------|--------|
| **CPU** | Motorola 68000 @ 8 MHz |
| **RAM** | 512 KB–1 MB (1040STFM standard) |
| **Graphics** | Low: 320×200 (16 colours) / Medium: 640×200 (4 colours) / High: 640×400 (monochrome) |
| **Sound** | Yamaha YM2149 PSG (3-channel) |
| **Storage** | 3.5″ floppy disk drive (720 KB) |
| **Operating System** | Atari TOS with GEM desktop |
| **Ports** | MIDI In/Out, joystick/mouse, ACSI (hard drive), serial, parallel |
| **Notable Feature** | Built-in MIDI ports |

The inclusion of **built-in MIDI ports** was particularly significant. It helped establish the Atari ST as a dominant platform in music production throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s — a role it retained long after its gaming prominence faded.


### Games, Productivity, and Identity

Although often perceived as a games machine — particularly in Europe — the ST occupied a fascinating middle ground. It was equally at home running arcade conversions, desktop publishing software, programming tools, and professional music applications.

Its crisp high-resolution monochrome mode made it well-suited to word processing and coding, while its colour modes powered some of the era’s most impressive home computer games.

For many users, myself included, the ST was a *first serious computer* — one that encouraged exploration well beyond games.


### Looking Back

The Atari ST represents a unique moment in computing history: when graphical interfaces were becoming mainstream, hardware was still approachable, and experimentation felt encouraged rather than abstracted away.

For me, it remains one of the most important machines I ever owned — not just for what it could do, but for what it inspired.
