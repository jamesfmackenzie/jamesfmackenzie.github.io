I received my first Atari ST in the 1989; a surplus unit from my father's business. It was a luxury (at the time!) 1MB model — the 1040 STFM, complete with Professional software pack.

Hooking it up to a colour television, I was captivated by the lime green GUI. I had never used a computer mouse before, and it felt like a huge leap from the terminal interfaces on the ZX Spectrum and school BBC Micro.

After clicking through every pack-in disk, I was (only very slightly) disappointed to find very few games.

But luckily for me, a friend had the more gaming oriented Atari ST Power Pack, and I was quickly able to borrow and acquire some great ports:

* Afterburner
* Black Lamp
* Bomb Jack
* Bombuzal
* Double Dragon
* Eliminator 
* Gauntlet II
* Nebulus
* Outrun
* Overlander
* Pacmania
* Predator
* R-Type
* Space Harrier
* Star Goose
* Star Ray
* Starglider
* Super Hang-On
* Super Huey
* Xenon

From Wikipedia: 

The Atari ST is a line of personal computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the company's 8-bit home computers. The initial model, the Atari 520ST, had limited release in April–June 1985, and was widely available in July.

It was the first personal computer with a bitmapped color graphical user interface, using a version of Digital Research's GEM interface / operating system from February 1985.

The Atari 1040ST, released in 1986 with 1 MB of memory, was the first home computer with a cost per kilobyte of RAM under US$1/KB.
