The **Lenovo M93p Tiny** is a compact business desktop from Lenovo’s ThinkCentre line, first released around 2013. While it was intended as a corporate PC, its **small footprint, quiet operation, and Core i-series performance** make it an excellent candidate for a **thin-and-light emulation PC**.

I purchased mine specifically to run console and arcade emulation from the NES through to GameCube and Dreamcast, all in a small form factor that fits neatly under a TV, with wireless controller support and minimal noise.

### Why the M93p Tiny works for emulation

Several traits make this PC ideal for a lightweight emulation setup:

- **Core i5 / i7 CPU** capable of running demanding emulators such as Dolphin (GameCube/Wii) and Reicast (Dreamcast)  
- **Compact “Tiny” chassis** fits neatly under a TV or in a living room entertainment center  
- **Quiet operation**, even under load, reducing distraction during gameplay  
- **Full Windows compatibility**, allowing RetroArch, LaunchBox, or similar frameworks  
- **USB ports** for wireless controllers, external storage, and other peripherals  
- **Low cost and widely available**, making it an affordable emulation platform

It’s the perfect mix of **performance, size, and price** for modern console emulation without building a full tower PC.

### Emulation performance

The M93p Tiny handles a wide range of systems:

- **NES / SNES / Genesis / arcade** – perfect, full speed  
- **PlayStation / PlayStation 2 (with PCSX2)** – smooth on most titles  
- **GameCube / Wii (Dolphin)** – high compatibility, full speed for most games  
- **Dreamcast (Reicast)** – playable at high settings  
- **Arcade (MAME / FinalBurn)** – excellent for 2D and simpler 3D titles  

The combination of a powerful CPU and integrated graphics makes it capable of running these emulators without the need for a discrete GPU, though PCIe upgrades are possible for extra 3D performance if desired.

### Advantages for a living room setup

- **Minimal noise** – keeps a TV room quiet  
- **Small footprint** – easily hidden or stacked with other devices  
- **USB controller support** – works with modern wireless pads or original USB adapters  
- **Energy efficient** – consumes very little power compared to a tower PC  
- **Windows compatibility** – allows use of popular emulation frontends

---

### Known limitations

- Integrated graphics may struggle with very demanding GameCube/Wii titles at max resolution  
- Only a single PCIe slot for discrete GPU expansion  
- Limited internal storage; external SSD or USB solutions are recommended  
- No native analog video output – requires HDMI/DisplayPort adapters for older displays

### Summary

The Lenovo M93p Tiny is an **ideal thin-and-light emulation PC**. It combines a small form factor, quiet operation, and sufficient CPU performance to emulate a wide range of systems, from classic 8-bit consoles up to GameCube, Dreamcast, and mid-2000s arcade hardware.  

It’s a perfect choice for those who want **a compact, unobtrusive, and capable living room emulation system** without building a full-size tower PC.
