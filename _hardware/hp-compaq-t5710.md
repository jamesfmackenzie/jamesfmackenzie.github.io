In 2019, I relocated from London to New York, leaving all my vintage computers behind.

In search of a retro PC (but short on apartment space), [I purchased a HP Compaq t5710 thin client]({% post_url 2021-07-11-hp-compaq-t5710-review-great-for-dos-and-windows-98-gaming %}).

Despite the 2004 build, the hardware is very well suited to DOS and Windows 98 gaming. Sound Blaster and Ad-Lib audio works even in DOS mode, making this a great all-in-one unit.

After some trial and error, I was able to <a href="https://youtu.be/V4DIPffO-sI" target="_blank">succesfully install and game on Windows 98</a>. I was [also able to find a working PS/2 splitter]({% post_url 2021-11-13-using-monoprice-ps2-splitter-with-hp-compaq-t5710-review %}).

Next, I experimented with the PCI expansion slot. After some success with PCI sound hardware, I installed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo2" target="_blank">3dfx Voodoo2</a>. It <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesfmackenzie/status/1492922391223283714" target="_blank">worked fantastically too!</a>

I'm super happy with this build. The t5710 is now my go to retro PC – I don't need anything more!
