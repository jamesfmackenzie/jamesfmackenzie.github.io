What do I want to say about the ST?

It is the successor to Atari 8-bit computers like the Atari 400 and 800
It has a 16-bit Motorola 68K CPU


From Wikipedia:

Atari ST is a line of personal computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the company's 8-bit home computers. The initial model, the Atari 520ST, had limited release in Aprilâ€“June 1985, and was widely available in July.[2][3] It was the first personal computer with a bitmapped color graphical user interface,[4] using a version of Digital Research's GEM interface / operating system from February 1985.[5][better source needed]

The Atari 1040ST, released in 1986 with 1 MB of memory, was the first home computer with a cost per kilobyte of RAM under US$1/KB.[6]


From my existing article:

Graphics glitches. Timing issues. Emulators suck. The best way to enjoy retro games is on real hardware.

With this in mind, I headed to the attic in search of my old Atari ST. After (too much) digging, I unearthed the beast:

Colour-coded monitor, system and keyboard. 4MB RAM. 30MB hard drive. Truly glorious.

After some time lost in memory, I fired her up. Fingers crossed, I waited for the hard drive to initialise ... success! They don't make 'em like they used to.

What about some old games? I rummaged through the disk box and pulled out an old favourite - Magic Pockets. Pop the disk in, hit the reset button and ... boot to the desktop!? That wasn't supposed to happen. The game was supposed to load! After a few more tries and a few more games ... mixed results. Looks like the years haven't been kind to my magnetic media.

But it's no problem, right? The internet is full of old Atari ST disk images. How can I get them running on the old hardware? Time for some research ...
