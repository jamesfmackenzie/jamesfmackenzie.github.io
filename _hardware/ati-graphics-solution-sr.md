When it comes to vintage PC graphics hardware, most cards did one job: they implemented a standard (CGA, Hercules, EGA, VGA, etc.) and stuck to it. But every so often, a manufacturer came up with something a little different.  

The **ATI Graphics Solution SR** is one of those cards. Released in 1987, it was ATI’s enhanced take on the IBM CGA and Hercules standards — offering flexibility, compatibility, and a unique trick that made it stand out.


### Features and Capabilities  

- **CGA compatibility** – Full support for IBM CGA graphics and text modes.  
- **Hercules compatibility** – Monochrome high-resolution graphics (720×348) for productivity apps.  
- **MDA emulation** – Works with standard IBM Monochrome Display Adapters.  
- **CGA-on-MDA emulation** – The standout feature: it can take colour CGA graphics and display them on an **MDA/Hercules monitor** in grayscale, making games playable on systems that otherwise had no colour display option.  
- **Switchable via DIP switches** – Users can configure the card for their monitor type and desired graphics mode.  


### Unique Selling Point – CGA on an MDA Monitor  

The **killer feature** of the Graphics Solution SR is its ability to **emulate CGA output on a monochrome display**.  

Back in the day, many business PCs were shipped with MDA or Hercules monitors — perfect for word processors and spreadsheets, but useless for colour games. ATI’s approach was to generate an **interlaced grayscale output** that mapped CGA’s colour palette into shades of gray, allowing games to run on hardware that was never meant for them.  

The result wasn’t perfect — interlacing introduced some **visible flicker** — but for owners of monochrome systems, it was a revelation.  


### Technical Details  

The card is configured using DIP switches:  

- **CGA emulation mode:** SW1, SW2 = Off, Off  
- **Monochrome monitor selection:** SW3, SW4, SW5 = On, Off, Off  
- **Hercules/Mono mode:** SW1, SW2 = On, Off

### Comparison to Other Cards  

Most CGA-compatible cards of the era were **straight clones**. ATI, however, added real value:  

- Compared to a **standard CGA card**, the GS-SR could also do Hercules.  
- Compared to a **Hercules card**, the GS-SR could also do CGA.  
- Compared to hybrid cards like Paradise’s solutions, ATI’s key differentiator was **CGA-on-MDA emulation**.  

This made the GS-SR especially appealing for machines like the **Amstrad PC1512 and PC1640**, which shipped with monochrome monitors but had owners eager to run games.  


### Legacy  

While the Graphics Solution SR isn’t as famous as ATI’s later **VGA Wonder** line, it represents a fascinating snapshot of the transitional era of PC graphics.  

ATI was already showing its hallmark design philosophy: **not just cloning standards, but extending them in useful ways**. For retro enthusiasts today, the GS-SR is an interesting and collectible card — especially for those who enjoy exploring the quirks of early PC gaming.  


### Final Thoughts  

The **ATI Graphics Solution SR** may not have had the raw appeal of VGA or the widespread adoption of Hercules, but its clever engineering made it a standout. It gave monochrome users a window into the world of CGA gaming and demonstrated ATI’s knack for innovative solutions.  

In many ways, this card laid the groundwork for ATI’s reputation in the graphics market — a company that would go on to challenge (and eventually merge with) giants like AMD.
