### Hardware

I have a GeForce 6200 PCI version. It's a nice passive card and one of the (relatively) rare PCI variants.

One observation from my experiments with a PCI backplane: although the card is keyed as both 3.3v and 5v PCI, the card will *not* work in a machine with only 3.3v. 

The card will not initialise and the machine will not post.

To get it working you need an ATX PSU that supplies 5v.


### Drivers

For Win9x (Win98SE in my case), I used the 81.98 December 2005 drivers from Phil's Computer lab:

Unfortunately performance was disappointing with big frame stutters.

For WinXP, I used two drivers:

93.71 October 2006 Forceware from Phil's Computer lab:

307.83 Feb 2013 GeForce Driver from nvidia:

Both perform *significantly* better than the Windows 98 driver.
