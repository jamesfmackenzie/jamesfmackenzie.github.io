I grew up using an Amstrad PC1640, and it’s a machine I’ve always wanted to own again. I was recently lucky enough to (re)acquire one — decades after my original had been lost.

This page serves as a record of the hardware, its place in history, and its restoration.


### The Amstrad PC1640: A Snapshot of the Late 1980s

Launched in **1987**, the Amstrad PC1640 represented a key moment in UK home and small-business computing. Amstrad had already found huge success with the PC1512, and the PC1640 built on that momentum with a faster CPU, improved graphics options, and a more expandable design — while keeping costs low.

At its heart was an **Intel 8086 running at 8 MHz**, paired with up to the PC-standard **640 KB of RAM**. While that specification might sound modest today, it placed the PC1640 firmly in the “serious PC” category at the time, capable of running mainstream DOS applications, productivity software, and an ever-growing library of IBM-compatible games.

One of the PC1640’s standout features was its **integrated graphics solution**, based on a Paradise chipset. Unlike many contemporaries, this allowed the machine to support **CGA, Hercules (MDA), and EGA-compatible modes** without requiring additional expansion cards — a significant cost and convenience advantage.

As with other Amstrad systems, the PC1640 followed an **all-in-one philosophy**. Rather than selling a bare system unit, Amstrad offered complete bundles that included the base unit, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and even bundled software. For many households (including mine), this made the PC1640 an accessible first step into PC ownership.


### Amstrad PC1640 Specifications

| Component | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **CPU** | Intel 8086 @ 8 MHz |
| **RAM** | Up to 640 KB |
| **Graphics** | Integrated Paradise chipset supporting CGA, Hercules (MDA), and EGA-compatible modes |
| **Storage** | One or two 5.25″ 360 KB floppy drives; optional 20 MB hard disk |
| **Display** | Monochrome (PC-MD), colour CGA (PC-CD), or enhanced colour EGA (PC-ECD) monitors |
| **Operating System** | MS-DOS 3.2 bundled, often supplied with GEM Desktop 3 |
| **Keyboard** | Full-size Amstrad XT-style mechanical keyboard |
| **Expansion** | 4 × 8-bit ISA slots |

While limited to 8-bit ISA expansion, the PC1640 was surprisingly flexible. Common upgrades included hard disk controllers, serial and parallel cards, sound solutions, and alternative graphics adapters — although the integrated video reduced the need for the latter.


### Impact and Legacy

The PC1640 arrived at a time when IBM-compatible PCs were still perceived as expensive, corporate machines. In contrast, Amstrad positioned the PC1640 as affordable, approachable, and practical — without sacrificing compatibility.

In the **UK and parts of Europe**, this strategy paid off. Combined with the PC1512, Amstrad briefly captured a **significant share of the British PC market in the late 1980s**, challenging far more established American brands. For schools, home offices, and small businesses, the PC1640 often became the default choice.

Although it lacked the raw performance of emerging 286-based systems, its balance of price, features, and usability helped normalise PC ownership outside professional environments — an important step in the broader adoption of personal computing.


### A Machine of Memories

For me, the PC1640 is inseparable from my early experiences with computing. It’s where I learned DOS commands, edited AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS, and slowly discovered how software and hardware interacted.

Revisiting the machine now feels like opening a time capsule. The reassuring clunk of the keyboard, the slightly unconventional layout, the tactile switches and dials on the monitor — all of it comes flooding back. These small, physical details are easy to forget, but they defined the everyday experience of computing in the late 1980s.

Owning and restoring a PC1640 again isn’t just about preserving hardware. It’s about reconnecting with a period when computers felt mysterious, slightly intimidating, and endlessly exciting.


### Games to Try on the Amstrad PC1640

Despite its modest specifications, the PC1640 can run a surprisingly rich selection of classic PC games — particularly titles designed with CGA or EGA systems in mind.

Some favourites that work well on this hardware include:

- **Prince of Persia (1989)** – Remarkably smooth animation and tight controls, even on an 8086.
- **Commander Keen (1990)** – Colourful, fast-paced platforming that shines in EGA mode.
- **SimCity (1989)** – The original city builder runs comfortably and remains hugely engaging.
- **Alley Cat (1984)** – A quirky early PC classic that’s perfectly suited to the PC1640’s capabilities.
- **The Secret of Monkey Island (1990)** – Playable with patience; a reminder of how far developers pushed early PC hardware.

Together, these games highlight the versatility of the platform — from arcade-style action to deep simulations and graphic adventures.
