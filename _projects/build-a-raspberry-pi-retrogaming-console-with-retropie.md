I'm a big fan of retro games, with many fond memories of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_generation_of_video_game_consoles" target="_blank">8-bit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_generation_of_video_game_consoles" target="_blank">16-bit</a> years.

And I'm looking for a way to relive those memories on the big screen.


### Project Notes

Status | Completed
Goal | Build a cheap, small and light device to retrogame on the big screen

I selected the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/" target="_blank">RetroPie</a> as the base for my build.

After a week of on/off tweaking, I found optimal settings and documented the full setup [here]({% post_url 2018-10-08-ultimate-retropie-setup-guide %}).

For Phase 2, I [configured Moonlight Game Streaming]({% post_url 2018-11-17-gamestream-moonlight-on-retropie %}) to allow low latency streaming of more demanding titles from my gaming PC.

Overall I'm very pleased with the result, and pleasantly surprised by how well Moonlight Game Streaming works.
