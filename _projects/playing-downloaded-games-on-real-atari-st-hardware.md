My old Atari ST disks are dead!

But perhaps I can download replacement disk images from the web and play on my physical ST?

Let's try it out.


### Project Notes

Status | Completed
Goal | Download an Atari ST game image from the web and play it on my real ST

I explored several options, including [floppy disk images and hard disk adaptations]({% link _howto/how-to-play-downloaded-games-on-a-real-atari-st.md %}). I was even able to [create a directly bootable game disk on the PC]({% link _howto/how-to-use-your-pc-to-create-a-bootable-atari-st-game-disk.md %}).

Case closed!
