I wanted a retro PC that could do the full “greatest hits” tour of retro gaming: **native DOS**, **Windows 98**, and **Windows XP**. But without spending silly money, without hunting rare parts for months, and without ending up with something that’s allergic to modern conveniences like SATA.

What I found is right on that knife edge: **new enough to absolutely crush late DOS and Win9x games**, but **old enough to still behave like a proper retro box**.


### Project Notes

Status | Completed
Goal | Find a low cost PC and turn it into a multi-generation retro gaming machine.

After some research, I picked up a cheap and old business machine — a [Dell Optiplex 380]({% link _hardware/dell-optiplex-380.md %}) — for only $60 shipped.

With the right parts and a bit of tinkering, this Core 2 system became a true triple-era machine, effortlessly running native DOS, Windows 98, and Windows XP. Late DOS games screamed along at locked frame rates, Windows 98 titles fly on a period-correct Radeon, and the adventure doesn’t stop there — it even stretches far enough to run Crysis, just for fun.

This project wasn't about rare hardware or expensive nostalgia. It’s about finding that perfect in-between generation — cheap, overlooked, and quietly capable — and turning it into a retro gaming PC that spans nearly two decades of PC gaming. I'll call this a success.
