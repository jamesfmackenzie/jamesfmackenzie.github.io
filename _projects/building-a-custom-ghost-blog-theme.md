![Custom Ghost blog theme](/img/posts/8-bit-Memories.png)

Before I switched to <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, I used the <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank">Ghost</a> platform for this very site. It's a crisp, clean, lightweight blogging platform.

But I wanted a custom theme. So I learned how to write one.

### Project Notes

Status | Completed June 2014
Goal | Learn how to write a custom theme for the Ghost blogging platform

I took some time to learn about the platform, setup my own developmemt environment and eventually write my own theme. Find it chronicled in the posts below.
