## Remote Play Xbox Series S/X Games on PC

Status | Completed January 2021
Goal | Stream / Remote Play Xbox Series S/X games from my Windows PC

With the Xbox One, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/apps-help/how-to-use-game-streaming-in-xbox-console-companion-app" target="_blank">I often used the Xbox Console Companion app to remote play games on PC</a>. Frustratingly, this feature was silently dropped for Xbox Series S/X – the Console Companion app just doesn’t work for the new consoles.

Looking for a solution, I was able to install a hidden “Xbox Game Streaming (Test App)” from the Windows 10 Store, and start streaming again. Full details [here]({% post_url 2021-01-24-remote-play-how-to-xbox-series-x-s-game-streaming-to-windows-10-pc %}). Case closed!
