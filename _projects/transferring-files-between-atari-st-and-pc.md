Can my Atari ST interoperate with modern PCs? What are the best ways to send files back and forth?

These are important questions that need to be answered!


### Project Notes

Status | Completed March 2016
Goal | Explore the various ways to share files between PC and Atari ST

I explored several ways to transfer files between PC and Atari ST, including:

- [Using an SD card and Ultrasatan to Transfer Files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ultrasatan-sd-card-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %}) - 08 Mar 2016
- [Using Ethernet to Transfer Files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ethernet-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %}) - 07 Mar 2016

I also took a detour into file compression, and learned how to split large files into chunks that can be individually copied using (for example) floppy disks:

My findings are summarized in the following guide:

Enjoy!
