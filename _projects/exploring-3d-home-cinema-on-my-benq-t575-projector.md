![BenQ TH575 1080p Projector](/img/posts/benq-th575-projector.jpg)

I recently bought a new projector — the **BenQ TH575** — mainly for movie nights and gaming. But while exploring the settings menu, I stumbled across something I didn’t expect to see:

![Projector menu showing 3D option](/img/posts/benq-th575-projector-supports-3d-thin.jpg)

Wait… 3D?

As in shutter-glasses 3D? On a 2025 projector?

I had to learn more!


### Project Notes

Project Status | In-Progress
Goal | Learn more about the 3D capabilities of my <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-us/projector/cinema/th575.html" target="_blank">BenQ projector</a>.

After <a href="https://esupportdownload.benq.com/esupport/PROJECTOR/UserManual/TH575/TH575_UM_EN_220830165100.pdf" target="_blank">consulting the docs</a>, I discovered that:

1. The TH575 does indeed support stereoscopic 3D playback
2. But only with glasses that use **DLP-Link** synchronisation

I hastily purchased some <a href="/img/posts/awol-3d-vision-dlp-link-shutter-glasses.jpg" target="_blank">AWOL VISION 3D DLP-Link glasses</a>, and (after some trial and error), was able to conjure some <a href="/img/posts/viewing-desolation-of-smaug-with-3d-frame-packing-video.jpg" target="_blank">impressive Blu-ray 3D video</a>.

Next up, I plan to try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_3D_Vision" target="_blank">3D gaming<a/>.

The project continues!
