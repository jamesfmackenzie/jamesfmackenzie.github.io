Back in 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a> (abbreviated Wasm) was in the zeitgeist.

It's a low-level, portable binary instruction format — and most importantly it allows programming languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in web browsers at **near-native performance**. 

I had to learn more.


### Project Notes

Status | Completed November 2019
Goal | Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a>. Understand how to make C/C++ code run in the Browser. Code some "Hello World" examples and document my findings.

I always learn best by sharing what I learn, so I chronicled my WebAssembly journey as four lessons:

- [Lesson 1: WebAssembly Hello World]({% link _howto/getting-started-with-webassembly-part-1-hello-world.md %})
- [Lesson 2: Graphics with SDL]({% link _howto/getting-started-with-webassembly-part-2-graphics-with-sdl.md %})
- [Lesson 3: Emscripten Loops]({% link _howto/getting-started-with-webassembly-part-3-emscripten-loops.md %})
- [Lesson 4: File System Access]({% link _howto/getting-started-with-webassembly-part-4-file-system-access.md %})

By the end, I was able to leverage this learning to [port Commander Keen to the browser]({% link _projects/porting-commander-keen-to-webassembly.md %}).

I hope you find it useful too!
