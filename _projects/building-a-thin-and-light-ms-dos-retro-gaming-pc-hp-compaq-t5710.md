After [DOS gaming on MiSTer]({% link _projects/ms-dos-gaming-on-mister-fpga-with-the-ao486-core.md %}), I was left wanting for more. The MiSTer felt underpowered, I wanted something a little faster to play Half-Life, Unreal and other Windows 98 classics.

In search of a retro PC (but short on apartment space), [I purchased a HP Compaq t5710 thin client]({% post_url 2021-07-11-hp-compaq-t5710-review-great-for-dos-and-windows-98-gaming %}).


### Project Notes

Status | Completed
Goal | Build a small and light gaming PC for DOS and Windows 98 gaming

Despite the 2004 build, the hardware is very well suited to DOS and Windows 98 gaming. Sound Blaster and Ad-Lib audio works even in DOS mode, making this a great all-in-one unit.

After some trial and error, I was able to <a href="https://youtu.be/V4DIPffO-sI" target="_blank">succesfully install and game on Windows 98</a>. I was [also able to find a working PS/2 splitter]({% post_url 2021-11-13-using-monoprice-ps2-splitter-with-hp-compaq-t5710-review %}).

Next, I experimented with the PCI expansion slot. After some success with PCI sound hardware, I installed a [3dfx Voodoo2]({% link _hardware/3dfx-voodoo-2.md %}). It <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesfmackenzie/status/1492922391223283714" target="_blank">worked fantastically too!</a>

I'm super happy with this build. The t5710 is now my go to retro PC – I don't need anything more!
