					<p>By day, I'm a Software Architect but love to stay hands on. I started my career in IT infrastructure but moved into software, spending most of the last 5 years working with Java and .NET. Today I also do a lot of web programming - especially AngularJS.</p>

					<p>I code in my personal time too, sharing my experiences on this blog. I've a million dot com ideas, but they never get my serious attention. I'm a serial hoarder of video games and retro computing hardware. I love automation and productivity hacks - scripting FTW!</p>
