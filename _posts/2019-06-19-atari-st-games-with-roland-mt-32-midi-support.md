We all love to hate the Atari ST's integated Yamaha YM2149F sound chip. It's 3 bloopy voices gave a decidedly 8-bit feel that suffered in comparison to the 16-bit competition

**If only there were a way to upgrade the ST's sound ...**

*Well there is*. Give this a listen:

Sounds great, no? By comparison the built-in ST sound chip <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohNUWvGHRPk&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">sounds utterly terrible</a>

But what magic is this!? Well it's a little-known fact that some Atari ST games - like Space Quest III above - pump out MIDI messages through the ST's built-in MIDI ports. Just hook up a MIDI synth for an audio treat

Space Quest III (and many other Sierra games) support both Casio CZ (good) and Roland MT-32 (great) synths. Use the built-in MUSIC.PRG utility to set your Music Device:
