You’ve just followed the [setup guide]({% post_url 2020-09-20-mister-fpga-install-and-setup %}) and have a freshly updated MiSTer. Next, you'll want to enable network access so can copy games/files and remotely configure your MiSTer. Here's how.

### Network Connection

Although the MiSTer <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/WiFi-setup" target="_blank">supports some Wi-Fi USB modules</a>, the simplest option is wired Ethernet. Simply plug a network patch cable into the MiSTer's RJ45 socket and an IP address will be configured automatically. 

#### Finding the IP Address

The assigned IP address will vary from network to network, and you'll need to navigate some menus to find it:

1. On power up, the MiSTer will display the *Cores* menu. 

2. From here, hit Esc the access System Setting and then Left Arrow to show *Misc. Options*

3. If networking is setup correctly, you’ll see the IP address (in this case 192.168.100.45):

Make a note of this address. You'll need it below.


### Shell access

For advanced MiSTer configuration, you’ll need remote console access. We'll use <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/Network-access" target="_blank">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>, which MiSTer has enabled by default. Here's how:

1. Download <a href="https://www.putty.org/" target="_blank">PuTTY</a>, a popular and multiplatform SSH client

2. Setup an SSH connection with the following details:

{:start="3"}
3. Hit *Open*. When prompted for a username enter <code>root</code> and for the password enter <code>1</code>

Now you're succesfully logged in, you can navigate the MiSTer file system. Some useful locations:

<code>/media/fat</code> | Micro SD card
<code>/media/fat/_Arcade</code> | Upload Arcade cores here
<code>/media/fat/_Computer</code> | Upload Computer cores here
<code>/media/fat/_Console</code> | Upload Console cores here
<code>/media/fat/config</code> | Per core configs. Generated by each core as you use them
<code>/media/fat/games</code> | Upload games/ROMs/images here
<code>/media/fat/MiSTer.ini</code> | MiSTer global config e.g. to change video mode / overscan


### Copying files

You can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">FTP</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">SFTP</a> to remotely copy games and files to/from the MiSTer. Here’s how:

1. Download and install <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>, a free and popular file transfer client

2. Choose *File -> Site Manager*. Hit *New site* and setup a connection with the following details:

![](/img/posts/mister_filezilla_connection_details.png)

*As before, the username is <code>root</code> and the password is <code>1</code>*

{:start="3"}
3. Navigate to <code>/media/fat/games</code>. This is where MiSTer stores all games/ROMs/imags for each core. Drag and drop files to copy

4. Close FileZilla once done

That’s the basics! Now you're ready to use some cores. I hope to publish some deep-dives soon. In the meantime find the list of cores on the excellent <a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki" target="_blank">MiSTer wiki</a>.
