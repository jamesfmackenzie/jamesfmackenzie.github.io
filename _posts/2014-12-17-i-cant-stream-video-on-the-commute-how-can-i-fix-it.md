I commute for an hour per day. Each way. It's a great time to catch up on news, blogs and other web content - and for this I use the excellent <a href="http://getpocket.com" target="_blank">Pocket</a>, keeping it topped up with plenty of reading material - ready to go at a moment’s notice.

One major bugbear I do have, though, is its inability to download and cache web videos for offline viewing. So much of today's web content is video, and my commute cellphone signal is way too patchy for reliable streaming.

So I need a way to automatically extract the video from my Pocketed content and sync it to my phone.

I'm not sure how to achieve this yet - time to start looking at the <a href="http://getpocket.com/developer/" target="_blank">Pocket Developer API</a>.
