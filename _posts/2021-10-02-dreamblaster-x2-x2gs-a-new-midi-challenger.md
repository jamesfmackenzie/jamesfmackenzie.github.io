Looking to give your system a MIDI boost? The DreamBlaster X2GS is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Wave_Blaster" target="_blank">wavetable daughterboard</a> that fits the Wave Blaster header present on many DOS-era sound cards.

The board itself is loaded with high quality instrument samples which it uses for MIDI playback, and it also has an officially licensed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_GS" target="_blank">Roland GS</a> soundbank – perfect for retro gaming and sounds very authentic versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Sound_Canvas" target="_blank">90s Roland synths</a> like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_SC-55" target="_blank">SC-55</a>, SC-88 etc.

Lastly it has an updatable soundbank – connect via USB and <a href="https://serdaco.com/downloads/X2/X2_Documentation/DreamBlaster%20X2%20User%20Manual.pdf" target="_blank">upload your own samples</a> for custom MIDI playback.

Once it's fitted, just configure your games to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Sound_Canvas" target="_blank">Sound Canvas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI" target="_blank">General MIDI</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPU-401" target="_blank">MPU-401</a> – the X2GS will spring to life and pipe beautiful MIDI music to your sound card's audio output jack.

Specs from the <a href="https://www.serdashop.com/X2GS" target="_blank">official website</a>:

DreamBlaster X2GS:
* Wave Blaster compatible soundcard featuring dual soundbank support
* Officially licensed, read-only 16MB Roland GS bank
* Updatable user bank (up to 48MB)
* Switch between X2GS bank and user bank using NRPN messages

Roland GS bank:
* Full GM/GS implementation
* 128 GM instruments
* 180 variation instruments
* More than 200 drum sounds in 15 drum sets + 1 SFX set
* All samples are in 16bit quality
* Official Dream/Roland License

Overall I'm really impressed with the X2GS. To my ear it sounds very close to original Roland Sound Canvas hardware – which means great audio for your DOS games!
