title: "I’m porting Commander Keen to PSVita. Should I continue with it?"

summary: |-
  I've been working on a **PlayStation Vita port of id Software classic Commander Keen**.

  As a foundation, I'm using the magnificent CloneKeen from Caitlin Shaw. It's a very impressive project and very authentic to the original Keen. So far I have the graphics engine running at a **smooth 60fps**, but no input or sound *yet*.
