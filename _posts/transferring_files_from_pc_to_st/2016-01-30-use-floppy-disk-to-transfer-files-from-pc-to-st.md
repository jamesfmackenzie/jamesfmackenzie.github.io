###Choosing the right floppy disks

For the vast majority of cases, you'll want 3.5" Double-Sided, Double-Density ("DD") floppy disks - they're the only variety supported by both PC and ST drives. They're also known as "720KB" floppy disks due to their standard formatted capacity. Unfortunately, manufacturing stopped years ago, so your best option is <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3-5-in-DSDD-720k-DS-formatted-floppy-disks-Double-sided-double-density-2DD-new-/291572499546?hash=item43e313445a:g:tHUAAOSwWnFWA6lR" target="_blank">eBay</a> or <a href="http://www.st-freakz.co.uk/page8.html" target="_blank">specialist ST providers</a>.

If you can't find any DD disks, it is *possible* to repurpose modern 1.44MB High Density ("HD") disks - albeit at a cost to reliability. HD disks have an extra hole on the right side (across from the write-protect slider), and if you cover this over with some opaque sticky tape (front and back), it'll fool the detector into thinking the HD disk is an ST-compatible DD floppy:

In very rare cases, your ST drive unit <a href="http://www.atari-wiki.com/index.php/Replace_internal_720k_DD_Floppy_Drive_with_1.44MB_HD_Floppy_Drive" target="_blank">may have been upgraded to support 3.5" HD disks natively</a>. If this is the case, congratulations! You can forget about DD disks and purchase higher capacity HD disks
