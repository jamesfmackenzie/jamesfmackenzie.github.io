At some point, you'll most likely want to transfer files from PC to ST. The common approaches are:

* [Use floppy disks to shuffle files back and forth between PC and ST]({% post_url transferring_files_from_pc_to_st/2016-01-30-use-floppy-disk-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* Use a serial cable (and accompanying software) to transfer files from PC to ST
* Use a parallel cable (and accompanying software) to transfer files
* Use an Ethernet adapter (there are various adapters out there)

I'll explore these in the coming weeks and post more details.

In addition, you mind want to split large files up to facilitate easier transfer. You can find more about that [here]({% post_url transferring_files_from_pc_to_st/2016-01-31-using-arj-to-split-and-copy-large-files-to-your-atari-st-in-chunks %}).
