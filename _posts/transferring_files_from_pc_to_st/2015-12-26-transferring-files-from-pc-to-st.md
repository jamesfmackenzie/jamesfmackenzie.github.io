At some point, you'll most likely want to transfer files from PC to ST. Some common approaches are:

* [Use floppy disks to shuffle files back and forth between PC and ST]({% post_url 2016-01-30-use-floppy-disk-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* [Use a serial cable (and Ghostlink) to transfer files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-02-06-use-rs232-serial-cable-and-ghostlink-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* [Use a serial cable (and ZMODEM) to transfer files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-02-13-use-rs232-serial-cable-and-zmodem-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})

* [Use an Ethernet adapter such as the NetUSBee]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ethernet-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* [Use SD card]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ultrasatan-sd-card-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})

In addition, you might want to split large files up to facilitate easier transfer. You can find more about that [here]({% post_url 2016-01-31-using-arj-to-split-and-copy-large-files-to-your-atari-st-in-chunks %}).
