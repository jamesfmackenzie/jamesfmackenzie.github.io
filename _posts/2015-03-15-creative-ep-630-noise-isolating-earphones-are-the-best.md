I hate headphones. Too much bass. Too tinny. Break too easily. Too expensive. Too much noise leakage. But after many years of searching, I've found a perfect compromise. **I'll continue to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-EP-630-Noise-Isolating-Earphones-black/dp/B009WQV15G" target="_blank">Creative EP-630 Noise Isolating Earphones</a> as long as they're manufactured.**

### What's to like?
* Cheap - only £10.99
* Good sound quality - certainly a great balance of treble/bass for my non-audiophile ears
* Great noise isolation - no sound gets in, no sound leaks out. It's so good, I even use these as earplugs on long-haul flights
* So good they even have <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Isolating-Dynamic-Earphones-improved-players-Black/dp/B008CNLCOA/ref=pd_sim_ce_8?ie=UTF8&refRID=01X3F6G8AM633AEQXK9A" target="_blank">imitators</a>

For me, nothing else comes close.
