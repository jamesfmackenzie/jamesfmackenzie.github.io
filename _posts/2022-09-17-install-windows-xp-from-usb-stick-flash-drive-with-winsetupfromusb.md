### What you need

* 8GB (or larger) USB stick
* <a href="http://www.winsetupfromusb.com/downloads/" target="_blank">WinSetupFromUSB</a>
* Windows XP ISO 


### Step 1 - Format USB stick

First, insert the USB stick on a modern PC and format as NTFS.

### Step 3 - Download and extract WinSetupFromUSB

When the extract completes, run <code>WinSetupFromUSB_1-10_x64.exe</code>:

### Step 4 - Prepare USB install media

WinSetupFromUSB should auto detect your flash drive. If not, select it from the drop down menu under *USB disk selection and format tools*.

Under *Add to USB disk*, find *Windows 2000/XP/2003 Setup*. Check the checkbox and identify the Windows XP source folder from Step 2 above.

Accept the Microsoft EULA and click *GO* to create the bootable USB stick.

### Step 4 - Verify files

Once the install completes, verify the USB stick is readable with the following files in place:

Also copy any *extra* files you want onto the USB stick (drivers/utilities/games etc). They will be available in Windows XP when the install completes.

Now you're ready to install Windows XP! Eject the USB stick and move to your retro PC.


### Step 5 - Boot from USB stick, install Windows XP

Insert the WinSetupFromUSB stick and power on your retro PC. The system will recognize the USB drive and load the WinSetupFromUSB menu system.

From the menu, select *Windows XP/2003/2003 Setup*:

The Windows XP install has two phases:

1. Text mode install (for disk preparation, copying installation files etc)
2. Graphics mode setup (for OS install, configuration etc)

Select *First part of Windows XP Professional SP3 setup* to start the first phase.
