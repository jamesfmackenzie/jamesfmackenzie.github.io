After a weekend spent rummaging in the parents' attic, I came away with some solid gold gaming artefacts from my past.

These (re)discoveries chart my video gaming education from child to adulthood. The memories!!

###ZX Spectrum (1982)

My old ZX Spectrum! I've fond memories of Horace Goes Skiing, Chuckie Egg and Manic Miner. Not such a big fan of the 20 (or so) attempts it took to load a game in the first place. I also came across a Prism VTX 5000 modem. Wonder if any bulletin boards still operate?

###Amstrad PC1640 (1986)

Back in the late 80s, I used to play PC games on an Amstrad PC1640. Although the hardware is long gone, I did find some old games: 

* The Amstrad PC Collection
* TV Sport Football
* Microprose Soccer
* 4D Sports Driving
* Lex Spelling Fun 1

Now, I wonder if there's any way to read 5.25" floppies nowadays?

###Atari 1040STFM (1986)

My "proper" games machine growing up was an Atari 1040STFM. I even broke open the case to add composite video support. Although the ST was pressed back into service some time ago, I did make the following rediscoveries:

* Atari ST Quickshot QS-131 Joystick
* Atari ST Nine Tiles Network Adapter AT-194
* Atari ST boxed games
  * The Chaos Engine
  * Speedball 2
  * Return of the Jedi
  * Magic Pockets
  * F1 by Domark
  * Cannon Fodder
  * Knight Force
  * The Munsters
* Atari ST Format Magazines

###Nintendo Entertainment System (1986)

Mostly intrigued by what all the console fuss was about, I bought a NES very late in the cycle. No regrets! As well as the NES itself, I also unearthed some gaming gems:

* NES Advantage
* NES Controllers
* NES games
  * Super Mario Bros 3
  * Super Mario Bros 2
  * Super Mario Bros
  * Kirby's Adventure

###Sega Game Gear (1991)

Game Gear! This beast could chomp through 6 AA batteries in only a few minutes. Taken on many a car journey, it usually died before too long; but it did have colour! I've fond memories of the Sonic titles, but I never finished them - much too hard!

* SEGA Game Gear
* SEGA Game Gear games
  * Sonic the Hedgehog
  * Sonic the Hedgehog 2
  * ECCO the Dolphin
  * Ariel the Little Mermaid
  * Donald Duck The Lucky Dime Caper

###PlayStation (1995)

Excitedly unwrapped on Christmas Day 1995, the PlayStation felt like the future. Stellar 3D graphics, massive CD-ROM storage, amazing memories. I probably spent more hours on this than any other console.

* SONY PlayStation 
* SONY PlayStation controllers
* Guncon
* SONY PlayStation games
  * Bust-a-move 2
  * International Track & Field
  * ISS2
  * Wipeout 2097
  * Crash 2
  * Crash
  * Gran Turismo
  * Final Fantasy VII
  * Tekken 2
  * Time Crisis
  * Ridge Racer

### AST Advantage! Adventure 575 Plus (1997)

The Internet arrived in the Mackenzie household via this AMD-powered 80486 clone. Running Windows 95, the machine itself was dumped years ago. But I did find old games - a few of which still prefer to run in DOS!

* Old PC Games
  * Destruction Derby
  * Unreal
  * Quake
  * Actua Soccer 2
  * Ultimate Race Pro
  * Magic Pockets
  * The Need for Speed
  * Red Alert
  * Civilization II
  * Microsoft Golf 98
  * Command & Conquer

###PlayStation 2 (2000)

A birthday present in the early noughties, the PS2 went to Uni with me. Many beer-fuelled hours of multiplayer gaming ensued - Gran Turismo 3 and Pro Evolution Soccer being big favourites. I also accumulated a stack of peripherals over time - and invested in VGA converters to squeeze PS2 gaming into my limited student space.

* PlayStation 2 controllers
* PlayStation 2 multitap
* PlayStation 2 Eye Toy
* PS2 USB converters
  * JS-909A play.com
  * PSXTOUSB RadioShack
* PS2 games
  * Final Fantasy X
  * Gran Turismo 3
  * Gran Turismo Concept
  * Metal Gear Solid 2
* V2 Action Replay
* Redant R2-6000 VGA Box
* Blaze VGA Adapter
* XRGB-2 Upscan Converter
* Official PlayStation 2 VGA cable

###Nokia NGage QD (2004)

Nokia's weird phone/gaming hybrid, I picked this up for cheap just as it was being discontinued. The games were bad, but I did hear of good emulator support - a consequence of the (relatively) open Symbian OS. Might invest some time in this!

* Nokia NGage QD and games
  * Virtual Tennis
  * Moto GP
