After a weekend spent rummaging in the parents' attic, I came away with some solid gold gaming artefacts from my past.

These (re)discoveries chart my video gaming education from childhood to adulthood. The memories!!

###ZX Spectrum (1982)

My old ZX Spectrum! I've fond memories of Horace Goes Skiing, Chuckie Egg and Manic Miner. Not such a big fan of the 20 (or so) attempts it took to load a game in the first place. I also came across a Prism VTX 5000 modem. Wonder if any bulletin boards still operate?

###Amstrad PC1640 (1986)

Back in the late 80s, I used to play PC games on an Amstrad PC1640. Although the hardware is long gone, I did find some old games: 

* The Amstrad PC Collection
* TV Sport Football
* Microprose Soccer
* 4D Sports Driving
* Lex Spelling Fun 1

Now, I wonder if there's any way to read 5.25" floppies nowadays?

###Atari 1040STFM (1986)

My "proper" games machine growing up was an Atari 1040STFM. I even broke the case open to add composite video support. Although my ST was pressed back into service some time ago, I did make the following rediscoveries:
