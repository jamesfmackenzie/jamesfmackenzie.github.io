As a long-time PC enthusiast, I can't help but feel nostalgic when I think about 3DMark, the iconic benchmark software and a staple in PC gaming for over two decades.

With each iteration, 3DMark has pushed the limits of gaming graphics, providing an exciting glimpse into the future of PC tech.

It all started in May 1997, when a team of developers at Remedy Entertainment released the Final Reality benchmark, in cooperation with VNU Labs.

Soon after, the team left Remedy to form Futuremark, releasing 3DMark99 in October 1998. Using DirectX 6 and Remedy's MAX-FX engine, 3DMark99 was one of the first 3D benchmarks to be directly targeted at the 3D gaming, versus assesment of broader system capabilities.

3DMark99 was an instant hit with gamers, press and industry, and 3DMark 2000 followed soon after in December 2000. This time the focus was on DirectX 7, with the Helicopter and Adventure tests featuring hardware transform and lighting, bump mapping, and LOD scaling.
