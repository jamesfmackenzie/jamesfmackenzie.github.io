summary: |-
  TIL you can remote play your own Xbox, in your own home, **from any PC and browser**.
  
  Was I the only one who didn't know!? 😂

  Thoughts after 30 minutes of gameplay:

  - It's pretty good!
  - Controls are responsive and latency is low.
  - Video quality is high, with very few compression artefacts.

  **I'll definitely use this when the TV is occupied!** Video capture below.
