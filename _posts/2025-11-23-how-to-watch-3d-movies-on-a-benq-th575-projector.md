I recently bought a new projector — the **BenQ TH575** — mainly for movie nights and gaming. But while exploring the settings menu, I stumbled across something I didn’t expect to see in 2025:

Wait… 3D?

As in shutter-glasses 3D? On a *2025* projector?

Well — that discovery kicked off an adventure I absolutely didn’t plan on. Find the full story below!

### Finding a Hidden Feature

I had no idea this projector supported stereoscopic 3D. But once I saw the option, my inner tech tinkerer demanded answers. A few minutes of research revealed:

- The TH575 *does* support 3D playback  
- But only with glasses that use **DLP-Link** synchronisation

So naturally…


### Buying the Right Glasses

I picked up a pair of **AWOL Vision DLP-Link 3D glasses**.  
Comfortable, lightweight, and (thankfully) inexpensive.

DLP-Link works by inserting a flash of white between frames. The glasses detect this flash, synchronise their liquid-crystal shutters, and alternate which eye is allowed to see the screen. The result? Each eye receives a slightly different image, creating the 3D effect.

Neat.


### First Test: YouTube 3D Trailers

YouTube still has a surprising number of 3D trailers. Using Apple TV, I played a side-by-side (SBS) version of *Avatar*. I switched the projector’s 3D mode to **Side By Side**, and…

It worked!

But… the image wasn’t very sharp. Which makes sense: SBS and Top-Bottom 3D literally sacrifice half your resolution.


### Understanding the Four 3D Formats

![3D mode menu](/mnt/data/B8864B37-E00C-4CC4-9CB2-07AED1A69B25.jpeg)

The TH575 supports four 3D modes:

- **Side By Side** — half horizontal resolution  
- **Top-Bottom** — half vertical resolution  
- **Frame Sequential** — better, but requires high refresh rates  
- **Frame Packing** — the gold-standard for Blu-ray 3D

Let’s break down the best option.


### Frame Packing: Full-Resolution 3D

![Frame Packing Diagram](/mnt/data/B93656D1-16FF-4B28-A121-DED6372C5749.jpeg)

Frame Packing stores both left-eye and right-eye images at full 1080p inside a single tall frame:

- **1920 × 2205 resolution total**
- Projector extracts each full-resolution eye image
- Produces the highest-quality 3D possible

This is the format used on **Blu-ray 3D discs**.

Perfect.  
And luckily…


### Time for a Real Test: The Hobbit in 3D

I still had a dusty old copy of *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 3D*.  
Time to fire up a proper 3D movie!

Except… no.


### Modern Consoles Have Removed 3D Support 😢

![Blu-ray 3D error message](/mnt/data/0D818829-1D51-463C-B91D-AE38EA968F3C.jpeg)

Both the **PlayStation 5** and **Xbox Series X** have silently dropped support for 3D Blu-ray discs.

Trying to play a 3D movie gives you this depressing message about “no 3D display detected.”

So, I had to go deeper into the retro vault…


### Enter the PlayStation 3 🕹️

The PS3 — that absolute legend.  
Not only does it support Blu-ray 3D… it was *one of the first devices* to implement the standard.

Time for attempt number two.


### Success! Glorious Full-Resolution 3D

And it works.

**1080p 3D Frame Packing.  
24Hz.  
Perfect sync.  
Amazing depth.**

Watching *The Hobbit* in full-resolution 3D on a huge projection screen is genuinely magical — way better than I expected.

I may have accidentally created a new hobby.


### Final Thoughts

What started as a random menu discovery turned into:

- A deep dive into 3D video standards  
- Buying new hardware  
- Rediscovering Blu-ray 3D  
- Resurrecting my PlayStation 3  
- Experiencing some surprisingly great 3D cinema at home

And honestly?  
It was *awesome.*

Time to hunt down more 3D movies.
