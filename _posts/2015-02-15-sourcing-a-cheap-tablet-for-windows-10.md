As [mentioned recently](/projects/2015-02-18-installing_windows_10_on_a_windows_8_tablet.html), I want to find a cheap tablet to try the Windows 10 Technical Preview on. Which one to choose?

Well I found the answer on a recent grocery trip. Tesco stocks <a href="http://www.tesco.com/direct/connect-7-tablet-with-windows-81-office-365-personal-32gb-wifi-black/182-3108.prd" target="_blank">this amazingly cheap, unbranded Windows 8.1 tablet</a>. I've no idea how they turn a profit, but after a quick check online, the reviews seem generally favourable. I'm sold. Time to [install the Preview]({% post_url 2015-02-18-install-windows-10-technical-preview-on-tesco-tablet %})!
