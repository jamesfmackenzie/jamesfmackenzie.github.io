I recently bought this GeForce 6200 PCI as a passively cooled GPU for Windows 98.

It was a bad idea!

In Windows 98, all games exhibit constant stuttering.

Direct3D performance is also much lower than expected - barely better than a (much older) Voodoo 3 2000.

For comparison:

* The Voodoo 3 is a 16MB, 143MHz GPU from 1999.
* The GeForce 6200 is a 256MB, 300MHz GPU from 2004.

The performance should be *way* better.

Initially I suspected a PCI bottleneck. The 6200 is normally an AGP card and may be held back by the (comparatively slow) PCI bus.

However!

When I try the same card in Windows XP, the performance is *way* better - almost double in some scenarios.


### Conclusion

The Windows 98 drivers are not good for this card.

Donâ€™t buy the GeForce 6200 (or probably any GeForce 6 series card) for Windows 98 gaming!
