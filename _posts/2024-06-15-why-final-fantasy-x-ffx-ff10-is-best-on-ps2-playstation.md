I recently re-bought a second hand copy of Final Fantasy X for PS2.

Why? Because, this is a game I've got really fond memories of, and when I recently went to play the remaster on PC - it just didn't look right.

Comparing some side-by-side screenshots, it looks like Square changed the character models. And at least for me, it's quite a big downgrade - definitely not how I remember it.

So for my replay, I'm going original and best - physical copy!

What are your thoughts? Do you like the remaster? Or prefer the old character models?
