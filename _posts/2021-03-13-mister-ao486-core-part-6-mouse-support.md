Many DOS games and applications need mouse support. Here's how to get up and running.

### Step 1 – Download and Copy Mouse Driver

1. We'll use the Open Source CuteMouse driver. Download it from <a href="http://cutemouse.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">here</a>
2. Extract the downloaded archive and find <code>ctmouse.exe</code>. That's all you need. It's in the <code>bin</code> folder
2. Use [MiSTerFS]({% post_url 2021-02-14-mister-ao486-core-part-2-transferring-files-with-misterfs %}) to transfer <code>ctmouse.exe</code> to ao486
3. In ao486, type the following commands to copy the driver to <code>C:\DRIVERS</code>:

```
mkdir C:\DRIVERS
copy E:\CTMOUSE.EXE C:\DRIVERS
```

### Step 2 – Install Mouse Driver

To install and activate the mouse driver, you'll need to update your <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>.

1. From the DOS command prompt, type <code>edit c:\AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>. An editor application will open. Add the following line to your <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>:

````
LH C:\DRIVERS\CTMOUSE.EXE
````

<blockquote>This loads the CuteMouse driver into High memory with default settings. Hit <i>Alt+F,S</i> to save, then <i>Alt+F,X</i> to exit.</blockquote>

{:start="2"}
2. Hit *Windows Key* + *F12* for ao486 core options. Select *Reset and apply HDD* to reboot ao486 and load the mouse driver. The following indicates a succesful load:

That's it – you're ready to play some games! Can I recommend Monkey Island?
