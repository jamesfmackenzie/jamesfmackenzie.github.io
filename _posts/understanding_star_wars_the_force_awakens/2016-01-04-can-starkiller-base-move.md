According to Pablo Hidalgo (Creative Executive at LucasFilm Story Group and author of the Star Wars visual dictionary), Starkiller base could indeed move:

"The Starkiller is mobile. Able to travel distances in hyperspace amid a very populous star cluster."

So, it wasn't a oneshot. Had the Resistance not destroyed it, it would have been able to continue its path of planetary destruction.
