According to Pablo Hidalgo (Creative Executive at LucasFilm Story Group and author of the Star Wars visual dictionary), Starkiller base could indeed move:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/SteeleWars">@SteeleWars</a> The Starkiller is mobile. Able to travel distances in hyperspace amid a very populous star cluster.</p>&mdash; Pablo Hidalgo (@pablohidalgo) <a href="https://twitter.com/pablohidalgo/status/683418491802664960">January 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

So it wasn't a oneshot. Had the Resistance not destroyed it, it would've continued its path of planetary destruction.
