Confused about the larger context within which The Force Awakens sits? I was too! So I went in search of answers. See below!

###What happens immediately after Return of the Jedi?

Despite the mass celebrations at the end of Return of the Jedi, it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

With the deaths of the Emperor, Darth Vader and he destruction of the second Death Star, the Empire is dealt a significant below, but not a crushing one.

Much of the fleet is still intact, including at least one Super Star Destoryer - the Ravager. Many sectors remain under Imperial control, including the Wookie home world of Kashyyk.

To control information flow and prevent mass defection to the Rebel Alliance, several Imperial-controlled sectors erect blockades, effectively holing up until they can stabilise.

###Formation of the New Republic

With many worlds freed from Imperial control, the Rebel Alliance declares itself the "New Republic", with Mon Mothma as chancellor.

She quickly rescinds the emergency powers enacted by Palpatine, restores a democratically elected senate and outlines a plan for disarmament.

Her aim is to introduce small, autonomous armies focused on planetary defence, resourced by reductions in the New  the Republic military.

###An Empire on the edge

Despite the blockades, planets continue to secede to the New Republic. In addition, several Moffs and Generals defect to the New Republic, relinquishing their Star Destroyers to the New Republic fleet.

Emboldened by the defections and bolstered by the reinforcements, the New Republic wins a series of military victories, rallying more and more planets to their cause.

Now one year after Endor, and in an effort to stop the rot, the remaining Imperials plan a do-or-die battle at the strategically unimportant planet of Jakku.

The fleets gather for the largest naval battle since Endor.

###The Battle of Jakku

Outfoxed and outmanoeuvred by the New Republic, Jakku ends in disaster for the Empire. Most of the remaining Imperial fleet is destroyed or scuttled onto the surface of Jakku (we see many of these wrecks in The Force Awakens).

Humiliated, and with no fleet large enough to mount a counter attack, the Empire is forced to accept a peace treaty, dividing ownership of the remaining sectors between the two groups.

###The First Order emerges

An radicalised Imperial remnant, displeased with the treaty, disappears to the edge of the Galaxy. Under the shroud of darkness, they plan to bide their time and strike against the New Republic when they least suspect it. It's from this remnant that the First Order emerges.

###The Resistance rises

The New Republic isn't naive to the lingering Imperial threat. Admiral Ackbar's remaining fleet is repurposed as The Resistance, with the express purpose of seeking out and destroying the Imperial remnant.

###The Breaking of the Fellowship

With the galactic civil war over, our heroes part ways.

Leia joins the Resistance as a general, Han returns to a smuggler's life and Luke departs for Devoran to start a Jedi temple and academy.

30 years pass, bringing us to the beginning of The Force Awakens.
