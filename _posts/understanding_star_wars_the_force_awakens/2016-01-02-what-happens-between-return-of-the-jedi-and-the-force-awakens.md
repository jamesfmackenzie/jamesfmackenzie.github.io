Confused about the larger context within which The Force Awakens sits? Me too! So I went in search of answers. See below!

###What happens immediately after Return of the Jedi?

Despite the mass celebrations at the end of Return of the Jedi, it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

With the deaths of the Emperor, Darth Vader and the destruction of the second Death Star, the Empire is dealt a significant blow, but not a crushing one.

Much of the fleet is still intact, including at least one Super Star Destoryer - the Ravager. Many sectors remain under Imperial control, including the Wookie home world of Kashyyk.

To control information flow and prevent mass defection to the Rebel Alliance, several Imperial-controlled sectors erect blockades, effectively holing up until they can stabilise.

###Formation of the New Republic

With many worlds freed from Imperial control, the Rebel Alliance declares itself the "New Republic", with Mon Mothma as chancellor.

She quickly rescinds the emergency powers enacted by Palpatine, restores a democratically elected senate and outlines a plan for disarmament.

Her aim is to introduce small, autonomous armies focused on planetary defence, resourced by reductions in the New  the Republic military.

###An Empire on the edge

Despite the blockades, planets continue to secede to the New Republic. In addition, several Moffs and Generals defect, relinquishing their Star Destroyers to the New Republic fleet.

Emboldened by the defections and bolstered by the reinforcements, the New Republic wins a series of military victories, a landslide of planets rallying to their cause.

Now one year after Endor, and in an effort to stop the rot, the remaining Imperials plan a do-or-die battle at the strategically unimportant planet of Jakku.

The fleets gather for the largest naval battle since Endor.

###The Battle of Jakku

Jakku effectively ends the Empire.

Outfoxed and outmanoeuvred, most of the remaining Imperial fleet is destroyed or scuttled onto the surface of Jakku to avoid capture. We see many of these wrecks in The Force Awakens.

Humiliated and with no fleet large enough to mount a counter attack, the Empire is forced to accept a peace treaty, with strict disarmament rules and reparations for the remaining Imperial territories.

###The First Order emerges

An radicalised Imperial remnant, displeased with the treaty, disappears to the edge of the Galaxy. Under the shroud of darkness, they plan to bide their time and strike back when the New Republic least suspect it. Over time, a new government is formed and the First Order emerges.

###The Resistance rises

Following Jakku and the fall of the Empire, the New Republic quickly ratifies its own disarmament act - achieving the early goals set out by Mon Mothma.

Leia, believing that the sidelined Imperials still pose a threat, she campaigns against hasty disarmament. As a result, she becomes sidelined herself, unable to participate in the political process.

Along with Admiral Ackbar, she founds the Resistance, a private military with the express purpose of monitoring the First Order.

###The Breaking of the Fellowship

With the galactic civil war over, our heroes part ways.

Leia remains with The Resistance as a General, Han returns to a smuggler's life and Luke departs for Devoran to found a Jedi temple and academy.

30 years pass, and despite persistent campaigning by Leia, the First Order are largely seen to operate within the terms of the peace treaty. They are left alone in the Unknown Regions to self govern.

This brings us to the beginning of The Force Awakens.
