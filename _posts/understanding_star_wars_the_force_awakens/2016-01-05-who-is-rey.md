Rey, The Force Awakens' titular character. Equal parts scavenger, mechanic, pilot and awesome Jedi warrior. But who is she?

Given how important lineage is to Star Wars, it's unlikely that Rey is a randomer. The audience know it, the writers know it, and the script has some knowing fun with it:

* In Maz Konata's cantina, Maz asks Han **"Who's the girl?"**. After an awkward pause, the camera immediately cuts to another scene.
* When Kylo Ren is informed of Rey's interference aboard Starkiller base, he immediately reacts with **"*what* girl!?"** - as if there's a specific girl he knows about.

Additionally, some hints were dropped at press events prior to the TFA release:

* Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, referring to actress Daisy Ridley: **"I was particularly taken by the fact that she kept talking about her family, Her mom, her sisters... we began to realize that many of the things about Daisy are things that are inside the character..."**
* Actress Daisy Ridley, when quizzed on Rey's lineage: **"I've said that I'm solitary, that's probably a big clue as to what it is."**

Finally, being the movie's main character, it'd just be plain bad script writing for Rey to have inconsequential background.

So what are the main theories concerning Rey's ancestry?

### Rey is Han and Leia's daughter (aka Rey is a Solo)

We know that Skywalkers are the strongest Jedi, and given how strong Rey is with the Force, it seems likely that she is too. For most of The Force Awakens, she seemed a natural setup for Han and Leia's daughter:

* Finds and deftly pilots the Millennium Falcon? *Check*. 
* Can fix the Falcon's hyperdrive in a pinch? *Check*.
* Instant rapport with an otherwise irascible old Han - to the extent they finish each other's sentences? *Check*.
* Kylo Ren taunts her: **"You feel like he's the father you never had"**.

It seems like a sure thing. But the theory seems to unwind as the plot progresses. Han and Leia clearly have no recollection of her whatsoever. Wouldn't they remember having a daughter? So most likely this one is false - unless there's some kind of mind wipe involved.

### Rey is Luke's daughter (aka Rey is a Skywalker)

OK, so Rey isn't a Skywalker by virtue of Leia, but what about Luke? Could he be the father? Let's look at the evidence for this.
 
* Luke's lightsaber calls out to her. Once Rey touches it, she experiences a powerful vision.
* Luke's droid, R2-D2, is powered down for most of the movie - only to magically reawaken when Rey first draws near.
* When Kylo Ren Force-interrogates Rey, he sees an image of an island amidst a vast ocean - an exact match for Luke's hideout seen in the movie's closing scene. Ren recounts how, as she struggles to fall asleep, Rey uses this image to bring comfort - suggesting a deep connection between her and Luke.
* The movie ends with Luke and Rey in a locked gaze - a moment that would be much more powerful if he is her father. The screenplay notes of Luke **"[there's] kindness in his eyes, but there’s something tortured, too"** and **"[he] doesn’t need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here."** 

OK, so it's a done deal, right? Rey is Luke daughter.

Well not quite. There's some troubling evidence against:

* Rey doesn't think Luke Skywalker even exists. In discussion with Han, she remarks: **"Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth."**
* If Luke is the father, who's the mother? And where is she now? There are no credible candidates and the plot would have to go through awkward contortions to make one.
* The Jedi Order are priest-like and devote their lives to the Force - no kids!

OK, so we have some problems. What other theories do we have?

### Rey is Obi-wan's granddaughter (aka Rey is a Kenobi)

We know the Force "runs strong" in families. Are there any other Jedi candidates out there?

Well there is. We know very little about Obi-Wan between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope - a period of 20-or-so years. Could he have raised a family - with Rey as the granddaughter? Let's weigh the evidence:

* The lightsaber that calls out to Rey wasn't just Luke's. Obi-Wan had it for a long while before that.
* When Rey touches the lightsaber, the voices of both young Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) and old Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) are heard .
* Rey is a natural with the Jedi Mind Trick - Obi-Wan's signature move.
* Obi-Wan and Rey share an English accent - unique amongst nearly all our heroes.
* Rey's creeping around Starkiller base is reminiscent of Obi-Wan creeping around the Death Star in A New Hope.

And, going back to Daisy Ridley's quote from earlier:

* **"I've said that I'm solitary, that's probably a big clue as to what it is."**

Well, only Obi-Wan can claim the solitary life of a hermit, right? It's adding up to a pretty compelling argument.

In the interest of balance, let's look at the evidence against:

* If Obi-Wan had a family, where are they at the beginning of A New Hope? He doesn't even mention them.
* Obi-Wan was a Jedi, the same as Luke. And as mentioned above, the Jedi Order tend not to marry or have kids.

OK, so this theory isn't a slam dunk either. Perhaps Rey really doesn't have famous lineage after all?

### Rey is the best student from Luke's Jedi academy

My final theory.

During The Force Awakens, we hear of Luke's attempt to found a Jedi Academy - and Kylo Ren's role in tearing it down. Perhaps, ahead of the destruction, Luke secreted Rey away on Jakku, protecting his brightest young prospect from a certain death at the hands of Ren.

This would explain her hasty abandonment, and also why Rey thinks there is someone coming to get her.

Well, there we have it. 4 theories, 4 sets of evidence. Which one do you believe?
