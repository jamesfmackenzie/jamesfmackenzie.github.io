Rey, The Force Awakens' titular character. Equal parts scavenger, mechanic, pilot and Jedi warrior. But who is she?

Given how important lineage is to Star Wars, it's unlikely that Rey is a randomer. The audience know it, the writers know it, and the script has some knowing fun with this:

* In Maz Konata's cantina, Maz asks Han "Who's the girl?". After a knowing look, the camera immediately cuts to another scene.
* When Kylo Ren is informed of Rey's interference aboard Starkiller base, he immediately reacts with "**what** girl!?". Seems like there's a girl he's looking for.

Additionally, some hints were dropped in press interviews leading up to the TFA release:

* Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, referring to actress Daisy Ridley: **"I was particularly taken by the fact that she kept talking about her family, Her mom, her sisters... we began to realize that many of the things about Daisy are things that are inside the character..."**
* Rey actress Daisy Ridley, when quizzed on the similaries between Rey and Luke: **"I've said that I'm solitary, that's probably a big clue as to what it is."**

Finally, being the show's titular character, it'd be just plain bad script writing for Rey to have inconsequential background.

So what are the main theories concerning Rey's background?

###Rey is Han and Leia's daughter (aka Rey is a Solo)

Given how strong Rey is with the force, it seems likely that she is a Skywalker. For most of The Force Awakens, it seemed like she was a natural setup for Han and Leia's daughter

* Finds and deftly pilots the Millennium Falcon? Check. 
* Amazing engineer? Check.
* Natural dialogue with Han? Check.

But later in the movie this theory starts to fall apart. Han and Leia clearly have no recollection of her whatsoever. So most likely this one is false - unless there's some kind of mind wipe involved.

###Rey is Luke's daughter (aka Rey is a Skywalker)

OK, so Rey is not a Solo. But could she be Luke's daughter?

* Explains her tremendous Force capability 
* Luke (and Anakin's) light sabre calls out to her
* The screenplay notes that Luke recognises her

However this theory also has a problem. If Luke is the father, who is the mother? There are no credible candidates and the plot would have to go through some awkward contortions to make one. Also, Luke is a priest like or messianic Jedi figure - we know they devote their lives to the Force - no kids!

###Rey is Obi-wan's daughter (aka Rey is a Kenobi)

* Obi-wan was in possession of the light sabre for quite some time 

Do some more reading on this one

###Rey is the best student from Luke's Jedi academy

Perhaps Rey doesn't have established lineage after all. Perhaps she's the miracle discovery of Luke's Jedi academy, and when things start to go bad, she gets secreted away on Jakku.

This would explain why she thinks there is someone coming to get her.
