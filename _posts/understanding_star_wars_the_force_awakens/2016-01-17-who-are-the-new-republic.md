From ["What Happens Between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens"]({% post_url understanding_star_wars_the_force_awakens/2016-01-02-what-happens-between-return-of-the-jedi-and-the-force-awakens %}), the New Republic are formed from the Rebel Alliance shortly after the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Endor target="_blank">Galactic Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor</a>:

*"With many worlds freed from Imperial control, the Rebel Alliance declares itself the "New Republic", with Mon Mothma as chancellor. She quickly rescinds the emergency powers enacted by Palpatine, restores a democratically elected senate and outlines a plan for disarmament. Her aim is to introduce small, autonomous armies focused on planetary defence, resourced by reductions in the New Republic military."*

The main aims of the New Republic are to restore freedom and stability to the galaxy after the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. For more information see <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/New_Republic" target="_blank">New Republic on Wookieepedia</a>.
