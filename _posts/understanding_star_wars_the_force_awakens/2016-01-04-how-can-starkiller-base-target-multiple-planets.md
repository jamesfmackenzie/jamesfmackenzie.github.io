How can Starkiller base target multiple planets at once? Well according to LucasFilm exec Pablo Hidalgo:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/SteeleWars">@SteeleWars</a> The beam is drawn to gravity wells. It splits to destroy the bodies in the system.</p>&mdash; Pablo Hidalgo (@pablohidalgo) <a href="https://twitter.com/pablohidalgo/status/683425644764516352">January 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

Well there you have it! The main beam is drawn to gravity wells.

But wait, with this being the case, wouldn't the vast majority of the beam's power be pulled toward the stellar mass (i.e. the sun) at the centre of the target system? ...
