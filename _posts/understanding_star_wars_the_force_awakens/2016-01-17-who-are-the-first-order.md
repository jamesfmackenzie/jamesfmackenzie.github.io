From ["What Happens Between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens"]({% post_url 2016-01-02-what-happens-between-return-of-the-jedi-and-the-force-awakens %}), the First Order are a radicalised Imperial remnant, displeased with the strict disarmament terms imposed on them after the <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Jakku" target="_blank">Battle of Jakku</a>. Post Jakku, they disappeared to the edge of the Galaxy, planning to bide their time under shadow of darkness - and strike back at the fledgling [New Republic]({% post_url 2016-01-17-who-are-the-new-republic %}) when they least suspect it.
