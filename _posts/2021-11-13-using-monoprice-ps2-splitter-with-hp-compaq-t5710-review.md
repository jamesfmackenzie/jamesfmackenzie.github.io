I've had several queries on using a PS/2 splitter cable to connect keyboard and mouse to the t5710 simultaneously. The good news? It works great. I purchased <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/392826957006" target="_blank">this Monoprice cable</a> and have keyboard/mouse working with the following setup:

* Connect your PS/2 keyboard to the *Mouse* connector and your PS/2 mouse to the *Keyboard* connector (yes, it's backwards – perhaps a manufacturing error with the splitter cable)

* <a href="https://www.parkytowers.me.uk/thin/hp/bios.shtml" target="_blank">BIOS 786R1</a> (Version 1.07, Revision A):

* Set <code>PS2 KB/MS</code> to *Keyboard*:

Good luck!
