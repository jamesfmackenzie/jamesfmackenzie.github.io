title: "Time to build a DOS gaming PC. Went for the cheap option, got myself one of these: <br /><br />- HP Compaq t5710 Thin Client <br />- 800MHz Transmeta Crusoe CPU <br />- 256Mb RAM <br />- Sound Blaster Pro hardware compatibility <br />- 1x PCI slot <br /><br /> Will definitely add Voodoo graphics, maybe OPL3LPT"
