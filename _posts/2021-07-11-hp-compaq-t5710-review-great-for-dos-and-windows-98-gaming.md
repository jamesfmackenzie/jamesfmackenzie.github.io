In search of a DOS gaming PC (but short on apartment space), I recently purchased a HP Compaq t5710 thin client. Although it was built in 2004, the hardware is very well suited to DOS and Windows 98 gaming. Some hardware features:

* 800MHz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmeta_Crusoe" target="_blank">Transmeta Crusoe processor</a> (x86 compatible)
* 256MB PC2700 DDR RAM (plenty for DOS and Windows 98)
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_R100_series" target="_blank">ATI Radeon 7000M</a> graphics (first-generation Radeon, surprisingly good DirectX/OpenGL 3D performance)
* VIA VT8231 chipset (featuring built-in Sound Blaster audio) 
* 1 PCI expansion slot 
* Wired Ethernet, 4 USB 2.0 ports, microphone and headphone jacks, PS/2, VGA, Serial, and Parallel ports

It ships with a 512MB flash module, fitted to a standard 44-pin IDE - which makes for an easy storage upgrade. I purchased a 4GB flash module for ~$7. You can also use an IDE to Compact Flash adapter.

The VIA VT8231 supports Sound Blaster emulation, allowing for Ad-Lib and Sound Blaster audio in DOS games. In addition, the PC Speaker audio gets routed through the headphone jack - a nice touch.

A PCI expansion slot is fitted to the motherboard, which gives us a lot of upgrade options. I'm very keen to try a Voodoo II and other PCI sound/video cards.

Lastly, like some laptops, the PS/2 port supports a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/392826957006" target="_blank">splitter cable</a> - so you can connect keyboard and mouse simultaneously
