Before I get started [on my bespoke Ghost theme](/getting-to-grips-with-ghost-themes/), I need to setup a dev environment - it's not a good practice to experiment with your live site after all.

My intention was to write a post explaining how to download, install and configure a Ghost dev environment on your local PC. Luckily, it's awesomely easy. The folks over at Ghost.org have written much better documentation than I ever could. Head over <a href="http://docs.ghost.org/installation/" target="_blank">here</a> to get started.
