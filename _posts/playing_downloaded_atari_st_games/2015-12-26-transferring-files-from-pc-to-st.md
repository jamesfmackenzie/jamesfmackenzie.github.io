At some point, you'll most likely want to transfer files from your PC to your ST. The common approaches are:

* Use floppy disks to shuffle files back and forth between PC and ST
* Use a serial cable (and accompanying software) to transfer files from PC to ST
* Use a parallel cable (and accompanying software) to transfer files
* Use an Ethernet adapter (there are various adapters out there)

I'll explore these over the next few weeks and post details.
