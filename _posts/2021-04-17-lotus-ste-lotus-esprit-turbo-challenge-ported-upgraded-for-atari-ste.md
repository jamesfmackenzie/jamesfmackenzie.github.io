Some retro gaming news. Classic Atari ST racer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_(video_game_series)" target="_blank">Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</a> has been upgraded to take full advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST#STE_models" target="_blank">Atari STE hardware</a> – 31 *years* after the original release.

<a href="https://twitter.com/RetroRacing" target="_blank">Jonathan Thomas</a> and Jamie Hamshere have performed miracles with the STE's BLiTTER and DMA sound hardware to create a new version that closely matches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" target="_blank">Amiga</a> release.

Enhancements include:

* More road surface detail and marking
* Single-pixel scrolling for roadside and horizon scenery
* Enhanced colour palette and sky gradient
* Sampled sound affects and engine noise

This is a huge improvement versus the original release and great news for STE fans – the STE was famously starved of "proper" game conversions back in the 90s heyday.

You can download Lotus STE over <a href="http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-lotus-esprit-turbo-challenge-ste_37660.html" target="_blank">on Atari Mania</a> and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/jonathanopalise/lotus-ste" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.
