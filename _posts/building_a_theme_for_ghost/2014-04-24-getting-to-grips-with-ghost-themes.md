I've been blogging on the Ghost platform for a month-or-so, and it's high time to ditch the [default Casper theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) for something a little more bespoke.

To keep me on message, let's outline a few project aims up front:

* Explore (at a high level) how Ghost theming works. How is design/theme separated from blog content?
* Learn the programming techniques necessary to implement a custom Ghost theme
* Design, create and deploy a bespoke theme for http://www.jamesfmackenzie.com

Expect a flurry of blog posts over the next few weeks as I work towards these goals.
