Since I bought an Xbox One a few months ago, I've had a nagging question on my mind. Can the One replace my Apple TV, Now TV and PlayStation 3 to become the only box I need for media streaming?

The One is already pretty strong in proprietry streaming options like Netflix, 4oD, YouTube and this library will only grow stronger over time. My main concern is with my personal media. I have a hefty catalogue of ripped DVDs. Can the One reliably play these from my Windows 8 PC, and can I retire the collection of other devices I have today?

Please join me over the next week whilst I explore this question and (hopefully!) come up with a working solution.
