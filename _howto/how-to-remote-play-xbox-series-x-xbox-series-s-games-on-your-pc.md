**Update 2021-09-14: Thanks to a recent upgrade, the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/apps/xbox-app-for-pc" target="_blank">Official Xbox App for Windows PC</a> now supports Remote Play. You can grab it from the Windows 10/11 Store.**

Ever used the Xbox Console Companion app to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/apps-help/how-to-use-game-streaming-in-xbox-console-companion-app" target="_blank">remote play Xbox One games from your PC</a>? Frustratingly, this feature was silently dropped for Xbox Series S/X â€“ it just doesn't work for these new consoles.

However all is not lost. By installing the hidden "Xbox Game Streaming (Test App)" from the Windows 10 Store, you can start streaming again. Here's how.

5. Play games!

Game Streaming is a great option when the main TV is occupied. I've shared some more thoughts <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesfmackenzie/status/1353344939472654336?s=21" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>
