## Transferring Files Between PC and ST

Status | Completed March 2016
Goal | Explore the various ways to share files between PC and Atari ST

Can my Atari ST interoperate with modern PCs? What are the best ways to send files back and forth?

I explored several ways to transfer files between PC and Atari ST, including:

- [Using an SD card and Ultrasatan to Transfer Files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ultrasatan-sd-card-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %}) - 08 Mar 2016
- [Using Ethernet to Transfer Files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ethernet-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %}) - 07 Mar 2016
- [Using PARCP-USB to Transfer Files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-02-24-use-parcp-usb-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-atari-st %}) - 24 Feb 2016
- [Using Serial Cable and ZMODEM to Transfer Files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-02-13-use-rs232-serial-cable-and-zmodem-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %}) - 13 Feb 2016
- [Using Serial Cable and Ghostlink to Transfer Files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-02-06-use-rs232-serial-cable-and-ghostlink-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %}) - 06 Feb 2016

I also took a detour into file compression, and learned how to split large files into chunks that can be individually copied using (for example) floppy disks:

At some point, you'll most likely want to transfer files from PC to ST. Some common approaches are:

* [Use floppy disks to shuffle files back and forth between PC and ST]({% post_url 2016-01-30-use-floppy-disk-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* [Use a serial cable (and Ghostlink) to transfer files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-02-06-use-rs232-serial-cable-and-ghostlink-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* [Use a serial cable (and ZMODEM) to transfer files from PC to ST]({% post_url 2016-02-13-use-rs232-serial-cable-and-zmodem-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* [Use the ST parallel port and a PARCP-USB adapter to transfer files]({% post_url 2016-02-24-use-parcp-usb-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-atari-st %})
* [Use an Ethernet adapter such as the NetUSBee]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ethernet-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})
* [Use SD card]({% post_url 2016-03-08-use-ultrasatan-sd-card-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-st %})

In addition, you might want to split large files up to facilitate easier transfer. You can find more about that [here]({% post_url 2016-01-31-using-arj-to-split-and-copy-large-files-to-your-atari-st-in-chunks %}).
