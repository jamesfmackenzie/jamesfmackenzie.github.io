## Lenovo Tiny Series Emulation Station

Status | Completed May 2020
Goal | Repurpose a Lenovo Tiny Series business desktop as a small and quiet retrogaming PC 

For many years I've been on quest to find the perfect emulation station. Something small and quiet, hidden under the TV, with a wireless controller and enough horsepower for high quality retrogaming.

Two years ago I [built and custom-configured a Raspberry Pi with RetroPie]({% post_url 2018-10-08-ultimate-retropie-setup-guide %}). A great device, but not really powerful enough for 32-bit consoles like PlayStation or Saturn. I need something with a bit more grunt, reasonable price (~$100) and good Wife-Acceptance-Factor (no tower PC!)

After some investigation, I purchased a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/m93-m93p/" target="_blank">Lenovo ThinkCenter M93p Tiny Desktop</a> from eBay for ~$100.

The form factor looks great under a TV and emulation performance is also great. Even Dreamcast and Gamecube run well, a significant step up from the Raspberry Pi. Full write up [here]({% post_url 2020-05-31-the-lenova-m93p-is-a-great-small-form-factor-emulation-pc %}).
