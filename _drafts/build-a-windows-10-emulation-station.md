# Why Windows 10?
Because driver support is great
Because emulators are fast/optimized
Because you can play other PC games on the machine too

# Why not Windows 10?
Not optimized for "controller-only" input
Have to spend time to make this work

# What are the options?
Launchbox/bigbox
Hyperspin (?)
Emulationstation

# What am I using?
Emulationstation. Needs more work but open source, free and flexible. More fun for me as a developer
