CONSIDER MOVING ALL OF THESE TO GITHUB ISSUES WHERE THEY CAN BE TRACKED AND PRIORITISED BETTER

* Publish old stories to Medium.com one by one - DONE

* Check Medium.com and Google Analytics statistics - DONE

* Create tag page - DONE

* Update index and post headers to have tags - DONE

* Why should people care about my articles? Put some kind of strapline at the top that gives me more credibility

* Refactor CSS for a general tidy up and to use config placeholders (e.g. for theme colours). Might be worth splitting CSS into individual pages first, so I can figure out what's common and what's not.

* Refactor duplicate content into includes

* Refactor config.yaml, remove junk

* Create about me page with links to GitHub, Stack Overflow etc

* Try out Google's keywords suggestion tool
https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal

* Run the site through W3C validators

* Address all the items suggested in Cal's SEO report 

* Start syndicating content to Medium.com (see my other email on this)

* Setup a feedburner

* Setup a mailing list and send blog articles out to those guys (feedburner have a solution for this too?), add the link to my content header

* Try some of these content hacks to drive growth - http://unbounce.com/content-marketing/9-content-marketing-growth-hacks-drive-traffic-conversions/

* Cleanup YouTube (one for jamesfmackenzie, one for retro rabble)

* Google rich snippets - https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/99170. Also do the same for Twitter

* Structured data - http://www.bigthinkingapplied.com/sharing-on-the-web-with-structured-data/

* Move blog to a subfolder or subdomain and create a dashboard or about me page on the front, including: GitHub commits, Tweets, Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange etc
