CONSIDER MOVING ALL OF THESE TO GITHUB ISSUES WHERE THEY CAN BE TRACKED AND PRIORITISED BETTER

* Fix header line and letter spacing issues (especially apparant on mobile devices)

* Create tag page - IN PROGRESS
** Why does it render as /tags rather than tags.html?

* Update index and post headers to have tags

* Refactor duplicate content into includes

* Refactor CSS for a general tidy up and to use config placeholders (e.g. for theme colours)

* Sign up for Medium, Mailchimp etc and get those links working

* Refactor config.yaml, remove junk

* Create about me page with links to GitHub, Stack Overflow etc

* Try out Google's keywords suggestion tool

* Run the site through W3C validators

* Address all the items suggested in Cal's SEO report 

* Start syndicating content to Medium.com (see my other email on this)

* Setup a feedburner
