As [discussed before]({% post_url 2015-09-18-playing-downloaded-games-on-a-real-atari-st %}), Atari ST disk images are freely available on the web, <a href="http://www.emuparadise.me/Atari_ST_ROMs/63" target="_blank">Emuparadise</a> probably being the best resource.

But how can you play these games on physical Atari ST hardware?

One way is to use your Windows PC to prepare a bootable game disk. Once it's done, pop the disk into your ST floppy drive, power-on and you're good to go!

Here's how.

###What you need

* Internal 3.5" floppy drive

You'll want to get a 3.5" PC floppy drive that uses the old 34-pin connector (insert link). A USB floppy drive won't do as:

* Some of them don't support the standard 720KB Atari ST disk format
* None of them support the "special" 800KB+ disk formats that many ST games use

You may have to go to eBay to pick one of these up - and watch out - a lot of modern motherboards are missing the old 34-pin connector.

It might be easier to purchase an old laptop from eBay with a built in floppy drive. Here's what I picked up for Â£20:
