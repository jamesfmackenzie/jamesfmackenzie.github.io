Shooting, Storing and Sharing 360 VR Panoramas

Whether it's a view from the highest holiday vista or showing off your new bathroom, no photo recreates the feeling of actually being there like a 360 VR panorama. Pan left, right, up, down, or even swivel right around to take in the whole view.

With loads of choices out there, what are your best options for shooting, storing and sharing your inspiring pano's?

Shooting

The best camera is the one you already have - and for most of us that's our smartphone. Modern smartphones are already equipped with all everything they need to take VR panoramas - namely accelerometer, gyroscope and CCD. The only remaining question is what software to use.

After some trial and error I settled on Google Street View. Intended as a data entry point for Google Maps, it also renders beautiful panoramas to your phone's Camera Roll in equirectangular JPEG format.

If you need better results, Street View is also compatible with the following 360 degree cameras:

* Ricoh Theta S
* Samsung Gear 360
* NCTech iris360
* LG 360 CAM

Storing

Stay away from the proprietary "walled garden" services out there. You want to store your panoramas in a plain, portable, future-proofed format.

My recommendation: stick with what you have. Google's Street View panoramas export as equirectangular JPEG images. The same format is accepted as input by most panorama-sharing sites and apps too. Take these and store them with your preferred photo backup service. 

If you spend lots of time in the Windows ecosystem, also consider the .pano file format. The Desktop, Tablet and Phone OS' have built in support for it. Just double click and get panning.

Viewing 

Aside from the Windows support mentioned above, there's no other native OS support out there. You'll need custom apps to tilt and pan through your 360 VR photos.

In addition to the Google Street View app, the free VR Camera app for iOS is also worth a look. Most of the other apps are either paid, walled gardens or total junk.

Sharing

With the lack of native OS support out there, your best option is to share panoramas via the web. 

With this in mind, Photosynth or Facebook are your best options. Both feature slick viewers in the browser and allow easy sharing with your friends.
