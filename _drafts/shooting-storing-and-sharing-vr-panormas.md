### Preamble

WHY SHOULD PEOPLE READ THIS? I've spent my last several months fully immersed in the world of VR panoramas (LINK TO some awesome examples I've shot). BUILD UP MY CREDIBILITY. I'm ready to share what I've learned.

### Shooting, Storing and Sharing 360 VR Panoramas

Whether it's a view from the highest holiday vista or showing off your new bathroom, no photo recreates the feeling of actually being there like a 360 VR panorama. Pan left, right, up, down, or even swivel right around to take in the whole view.

With loads of choices out there, what are your best options for shooting, storing and sharing your inspiring pano's?

### Shooting

The best camera is the one you already have - and for most of us that's our smartphone. Modern smartphones are already equipped with all everything they need to take VR panoramas - namely accelerometer, gyroscope and CCD. The only remaining question is what software to use.

After some trial and error I settled on <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/streetview/apps/">Google Street View</a>. Intended as a data entry point for Google Maps, it also renders beautiful panoramas to your phone's Camera Roll in JPEG format.

If you need better results, Street View is also compatible with the following 360 degree cameras:

* Ricoh Theta S
* Samsung Gear 360
* NCTech iris360
* LG 360 CAM

### Storing

Stay away from the proprietary "walled garden" services out there. You want to store your panoramas in a plain, portable, future-proofed format.

My recommendation: stick with what you have. Google's Street View panoramas export as JPEG images in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection" target="_blank">equirectangular projection</a>. The same format is accepted as input by most panorama-sharing sites and apps too. Take these and store them with your preferred photo backup service.

If you spend lots of time in the Windows ecosystem, also consider the [.pano file format]({% post_url 2016-10-29-what-are-pano-files %}). The Desktop, Tablet, Phone and OneDrive have built in support for it. Just double click to get panning.

<!-- 

ADD THESE NOTES LATER ON ONCE THE ARTICLES ARE FINISHED
It's relatively easy to convert from one to the other: 

* Converting from equirectangular projection to .pano
* Converting from .pano to equirectangular projection
-->

### Viewing 

Aside from the Windows support mentioned above, there's no native OS capability out there. You'll need custom apps (or "Players") to tilt and pan through your 360 VR photos.

In addition to the Google Street View app, the free <a href="https://appsto.re/gb/2CTBbb.i" target="_blank">VR Camera app</a> for iOS is also worth a look. Most of the other iOS options are either paid, walled gardens or total junk.

For other platforms, checkout <a href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Panorama_Viewers" target="_blank">this comprehensive list</a>.

### Sharing

With no convergence around a popular, cross-platform Player, your best option is to share panoramas via the web. 

With this in mind, <a href="https://photosynth.net/" target="_blank">Photosynth</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> are great options. Both feature slick viewers in the browser and allow easy sharing with your friends. To get started with these, see:

* [Publishing VR Panoramas to Facebook]({% post_url 2016-10-12-publishing-equirectangular-360-vr-panorama-to-facebook %})
* [Publishing VR Panoramas to Photosynth]({% post_url 2016-10-28-publishing-equirectangular-360-vr-panorama-to-photosynth %})

If you shoot (or [convert to]({% post_url 2016-10-30-convert-equirectangular-360-vr-panorama-to-pano-file %})) [.pano files]({% post_url 2016-10-29-what-are-pano-files %}), your best option is definitely <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-gb/" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>. Simply upload the .pano and the share the link:
