I spend far too much time reading the news. It doesn't just arrive once a day anymore - it arrives continually. I'm filling all my spare moments checking for updates. Moments that could be *much* better spent.

That said, I don't want to disengage from news completely. I like to keep up with current affairs. What I want to do is *minimize* this time. Get the most bang for my buck.

Heading to Twitter, I found the following:

@bbcnewsmostread - "Most Read" articles from BBC News
@polygonfeatured - Featured articles from Polygon 
@redditprogtop - Reddit Programming Stories that enter the Weekly Top 10
@redditpopular - Reddit Home Page Stories that enter the Weekly Top 10
@vergefeatured - Featured articles from The Verge
@xkcd

Combining these into a single "News Feed" list gives me a one-stop News shop. Since the content comes from curated sources, it's low-noise and the volume is manageable. As an added bonus, it's already in Twitter, so adding commentary or sharing via social media is frictionless.

Now I only need 5-10 minutes per day to stay informed. Hope this encourages you to create your own news mash-up!
