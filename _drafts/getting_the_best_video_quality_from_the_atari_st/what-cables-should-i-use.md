What cables should I buy?

If you only care about ST High res:
* Buy pretty much any "ST to VGA" cable from eBay
* It'll (almost certainly) work with your existing LCD monitor

If you only care about ST Medium/Low res (for games):
* Buy this RGB SCART cable from eBay: http://www.retrocomputershack.com/PDF/A ... 20Lead.pdf
* Find a LCD panel like the Alba models mentioned above

If you want to use your existing LCD monitor for ST Low/Medium res:
* There's a (very small) chance that your existing LCD panel already accepts the 15khz signal that your ST outputs. Find a list of these models here: http://www.atari-wiki.com/index.php/Flat_Panel_Displays

If you really care about image quality:
* Consider a dedicated upscaling unit. These will upscale the ST image much better than the internal circuitry in most modern panels/monitors: http://retrogaming.hazard-city.de/framemeister.htM

If you want an authentic experience:
* Don't go with LCD. Instead buy an original SC1224 colour monitor (or some other multisync unit)

In general, don't bother with Composite or S-video mods. RGB SCART will give you an objectively better image than both of these.
