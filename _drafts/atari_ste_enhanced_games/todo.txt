Write about Atari STE enhanced games and screenshot them side by side with regular ST games

Capabilities
---
The main hardware differences to the normal ST were:  

4096 colour palette
DMA 8 bit Stereo-Sound with up to 50 khz digisound replay
two additional Joypadports (for Jagpad)
graphic coprocessor chip Blitter.
easy to upgrade SIMM based memory (up to 4 MB)
Genlock support

Next step: find some games that exploit these capabilities and compare them!

*********

Not working on STE:
This includes not TOS version caused problems, only
games writing to bad locations.

Note: some games may fail on 4MB machines because lame code.

Many of cracks fail on higher TOS versions, so please test with
original or Pasti images if possible.

Really not working:
Hyperforce - overshot in palette writing loop
Grand Monster Slam - overshot in palette writing loop
Nightdown - writing to Screen pointer does nothing on ST, on STE bus error.

Total 3 games found so far - not solveable by changing TOS vers., RAM setting or similar.

I made fixed versions of them, and it means changing only couple bytes. In case of Grand Monster Slam it is done even with STX img.


As TOS version caused problem good example is Defender of the Crown: code is not ready for enhanced palette of STE, handled via XBIOS calls. If run under TOS 1.04 on STE it works fine.
How to use TOS 1.04 on STE ? See on Floppy Image Runner site.

Making complete list of originals not working on regular STE with TOS 1.06/1.62 would take too much time. I guess that over 90% works.
TOS 2.05/2.06 (Mega STE) : I guess that success rate is under 80%.

What helps in case of problem: Try another crack. Try running from AUTO folder. Use specialised SW for setting machine to act as having only 512KB (or 1MB) RAM. Install TOS 1.04 in RAM.
