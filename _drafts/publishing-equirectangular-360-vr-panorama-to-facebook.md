A little-known but extremely cool feature: Facebook has built-in support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VR_photography" target="">360Â° VR panorama photos</a>. These interactive images allow you to tilt and around a scene, creating a fully immersive experience of "being there".

Find out how upload your own below.

### Source or shoot your own VR photo

Either <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=equirectangular+vr+photo&rlz=1CDGOYI_enGB653GB654&hl=en-GB&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMi6_uptLPAhXFECwKHYiRDOAQ_AUIBygB&biw=414&bih=660" target="">head to Google</a> or shoot your own (LINK) VR panorama. The stipulations are:

* The image must use an equirectangular projection
* The image must have a 2:1 aspect ratio (i.e. twice as wide as they are high)

### Upload to Facebook as a single photo

Upload your VR photo to Facebook as a single image (this won't work as part of an batch). Facebook will quickly recognise your VR image
