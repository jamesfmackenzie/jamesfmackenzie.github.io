title: Updating a GitHub-hosted Jekyll Blog from iOS

Fed up with paying to host my blog, I recently migrated to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/" target="">GitHub Pages and Jekyll</a>. There's a minor learning curve, and the move back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Static_web_page" target="_blank">static content</a> takes a bit of getting used to, but overall I'm impressed by Jekyll's simplicity and flexibility.

The page content itself is stored on GitHub, and on Windows/OSX, it's easy to push updates via <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop</a>.

Unfortunately mobile is another story. On iOS at least, there's no official GitHub client, making mobile blog updates painful.

After a bit of research, I settled on <a href="http://workingcopyapp.com/" target="_blank">Working Copy</a> as the best option. Some of my favourite features:

* Work Offline - prepare blog updates whilst offline e.g. on the plane
* Integration with other iOS - use your favourite markdown/source editor (e.g. Textastic) to prepare updates
