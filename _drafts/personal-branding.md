Define a goal

First, you need to define your goal. Why do you want to work on that brand?

Like I said before, maybe you want a bigger paycheck, want to be a freelancer or just want more opportunities to choose from, but you need to define your goal. After doing this, you need to define your brand. How do you want people to see you? How do you want people to think about you? You need to find something that makes you unique. It’s somewhat tricky, since I could be a good JavaScript developer out there but there are more JavaScript developers who are better than me, so you need to find the secret sauce that will make you unique, and it will be something you will always work on. Never lie to yourself or to other people because it’s going to hurt you more than anything else.

Don't push yourself

There are some typical errors that programmers make when they start personal branding, and the most serious one is that they push themselves too much. They try to do everything and attempt to push themselves to everywhere. Do not open every account and do not try to do everything everywhere－you should only do the things that make a lot sense and impact for you, and only do the things you have time to do. You can just start a blog and forget everything else, and you don’t need to do the things that you don’t like or things that make no sense to you. 

Do branding as part of your day job

Don’t think this is about something seperate, and instead, optimize what you have already done. For example, if you have expertise in some specific languages and you have a lot of cool projects that you worked on, why not put them somewhere available? Github, Bitbucket , etc. You are still continuing to do what you love and to work on your technical skills, but you are going to have something online for people to see and participate in. Or, say you want to learn more about some specific programing language－why not write some posts about how you learned this programing language and about the problems you ran into? There are a lot of things you can do to polish your personal brand.

Be authentic

Don’t be afraid to show your true color and don’t be afraid to show your true self. I have seen many accounts that are business-driven and I think it’s all right. However, personally I like people to be more human, I like them for being honest to people and to themselves.

Do what you love

Your brand should be around something you like (e.g. developing software, API, mobile development, etc). If you don’t like something and you just take it up because it could lead you to success, you will always need to create passion for yourself.

Be on Google

If you are not on Google, you’ve never existed－we’re living in a world where you only exist if you are searchable. When I am hiring people, I will google them and try to get some information. I feel a little like a stalker when I do this, but I’m not actually interested in their lives–I just want to know what kind of person they are.

Start a blog

A lot of people are saying blog and podcasts are dead, but I don’t believe this. You can write about anything–you can blog about your life and share things that you want to share to help people understand who you are. I know a lot of people who have really technical blogs where they write about their expertise, which is really great because they can showcase their skills and their experience. There are a lot of blog platforms out there to do this without paying too much: WordPress, Medium, Github Pages, etc.

I would suggest you to choose one specific topic, and stick to it. By doing so, people will come to your website consistently for the great content you create, and it will be easier to build an audience this way. Posting three or four posts a week or so is a good way for you to alternate between personal stuff and professional content.

Be on social media

Some people may think Facebook and Twitter are a waste of time, and while they could be a waste of time, I want to add that social media allows you to build a great network with people. You can also always find something interesting and helpful on social media. When I was a freelancer, I’ve been contacted by people through Twitter. Those people did not know me, but they contacted me because they’ve read some of my posts. Therefore, it’s really important to have visibility on social media, since you will find your potential customers and co-workers.

There are some tips to track your brand on social media. I usually use Google Alert to track my name and my projects because I want to know what people are talking about. Maybe sometime they are talking about me because they like the stuff I make. Maybe sometime they are complaining about something. They may be right, or perhaps they don’t understand something. So I have those tools. On Twitter, I have Tweetdeck and the search column has the exact same terms, so I’ll know when people are talking about me. I also have my facebook notification, LinkedIn notification, and google plus, and I like to reply people, answer their questions, and be there when they want to talk to me.

Speak at conferences

This may be something that seems intimidating, so my advice is to start from talking to ten people, and then try practice with a larger and larger audience until you can speak at a conference with hundreds of people. You will have the most amazing experience after you accomplish this, and it will change your life. When you stand on the stage, it will give you great visibility and help you build connections after the end of the conference.

If you don’t have any experience speaking in front of an audience, don’t be afraid to ask for help from good public speaker. Try to find some user group and join it. Interact with people. If there’s no such one group in your specific topic, why not just create one?

Create something

I don’t mean that you need to create a company. You can find something interesting to do, and do it during the weekend. It may not always be about money; it could be just about the community.

For example, I run an user group and I don’t earn money from it. It takes me time, but I like giving back to the community, and you never know when other people will help you back. You can do so in many different ways, such as answering questions on StackOverflow. Answering questions and sharing your ideas will help you build a good profile there and make people trust your expertise. Write some documentation or report bugs, as reporting bugs and contributing to open source projects could help you learn more about your expertise. What’s more, you could write these things into you CV, Linkedin Profile or Facebook profile. So, if you have some design skills, then showcase your skills to the rest of world.

Get a certification

Some companies strongly believe in certifications. If you don’t like school, or you don’t like getting a diploma, it will still be great to have a certification because you can show your expertise, or at least show what you can do. It’s a great tool, depending on how you use it.

Get industry recognition

A great example would be Microsoft, as they have this Microsoft MVP﹣the Most Valuable Professional. They don’t give this recognition to many people. I was in Canada and there were 50 people with different expertises. In Mozilla as well, they have the ReMo title they give to people who are really involved in specific technologies and doing great stuff in the community.

You could write these kind of things in your resume and showcase that you are not only recognized by peers, but also by great company like Microsoft who has already seen so many developers. It’s another way to get visibility and showcase your expertise to other people.

Network, network and network

I know many developers are introverts and are not good at social stuff. You can start networking from your workspace. Maybe go to lunch with colleagues and talk to each other, trying to meet more people. Ideally you should go to local groups and meetups to get a drink, even if you don’t drink alcoholーnetworking is super important, so get yourself out there. There are a lot of networking events for technical and non-technical people, so you don’t have to restrict yourself to only technical networking events. In fact, everything is a networking event. Go to conferences and talk to people after the break, and go to parties and talk to people. You’ll never know whether the person you’re talking to will be your next boss or business partner or client in the future. So, talk to people and build your network online and offline. Linkedin is a great example of where you can network online.
