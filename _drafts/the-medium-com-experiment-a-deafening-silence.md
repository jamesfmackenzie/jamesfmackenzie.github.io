The Medium.com Experiment Part 1

Spurred on by a recent buffer blog article (you should post your content to Medium), and on the promise of 650,000 eyeballs just waiting to read my content, I decided to take the plunge and publish some content to Medium

After signing up, I wrote, dutifully tagged and published a few articles over 1 week:

<INSERT PICTURE OF PUBLISHING AN ARTICLES HERE>

Not a sausage

<INSERT PICTURE OF VIEWS HERE>

What I've learned so far:

Tags are useless for content discovery 

Even if I had written the best, most insightful content ever, no one would have ever read it

Other mechanics for content discovery:

* Publish content externally (seems to defeat the purpose of Medium.com altogether)

* Get followers by engaging with the community 

* Kindly approach popular Publications and ask them to publish my content (Medium.com has no built in mechanism for this, you'll have to resort to some detective work and approach the publication owners directly. And then be *really* nice to them)
