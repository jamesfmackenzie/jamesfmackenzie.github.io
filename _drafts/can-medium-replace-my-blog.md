And maybe a second one about dual posting to Medium

Medium as a personal blog
---

Pros:
* Ready made audience of 650,000 passionate readers
* Beautiful design that "just works" on desktop and mobile
* Post easily from anywhere
* Built in commenting and sharing features
* In words: you focus on the writing, they take care of everything else

You can leave medium.com links on forums without seeming spammy

Cons:
* You don't own your audience, Medium does - I.e. No mailing lists
* All Medium.com URLs are "nofollow". This means that Google and other search engines downrank them (does it?)
* This is to prevent SEOs from spamming Medium.com to inflate their own backlinks
* It means that anything you put on Medium.com is unlikely to rank high on Google - so you won't get organic search traffic (I.e. potential new customers)
* Perhaps this doesn't matter for you
* Medium.com don't perceive this as an issue - they want readership to come from registered Medium.com users - who can subscribe to blogs and receive push notifications for new postings

* The is some evidence that Medium is loosening up on this (see https://medium.com/@sm/what-about-the-fact-that-medium-makes-all-links-nofollow-even-if-from-a-hosted-domain-b2f5a3b21499#.hsutjn9ht). Perhaps they've found a way to distinguish "original, quality content" from backlinks spam?

Who is it great for?
* Personal bloggers

Not so great for:
* Business blogs that want to generate sales

Best approach:
* Dual post to Medium.com a few days later
* Use API, IFTTT or Import to make sure links have the "canonical" tag (otherwise Google may view the content as spam and downrank you)
* Put a backlink to your original article at the top or bottom of your Medium.com post

Why should I wait a few days?
* Drive audience to your primary site
* Make sure Google knows your copy is the original (i.e. it gets indexed first)
