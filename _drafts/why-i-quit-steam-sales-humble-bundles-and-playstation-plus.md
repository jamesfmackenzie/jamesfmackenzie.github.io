title: Why I Quit Steam Sales, Humble Bundles and PlayStation Plus

Background:
* Massive games backlog
* Constant "free" or "cheap" games- compulsively participated in all sales
* Way too much demand on my (very limited) time
* Games becoming no fun - feel guilty for playing them more than absolutely necessary, FOMO on something better

Realisation:
* There is no negative consequence to "missing out"
* So why not take the time to enjoy games

Action:
* Quit from PlayStation Plus with immediate effect - I don't play online and don't need the Instant Game Collection
* Stop participating in Steam Sales or Humble Bundles
* Only buy games just as I'm about to play them
