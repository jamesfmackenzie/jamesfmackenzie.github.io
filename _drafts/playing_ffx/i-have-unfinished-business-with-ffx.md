Back in 2002, during peak PlayStation 2, I did a full play though of Final Fantasy X. Although initially a bit miffed by the uninspiring (and even downright annoying) main characters, I was eventually won over - captivated by the plot, character progression mechanics and (at the time) jaw-dropping graphics.

But even after felling the final boss, some of the Monster Arena creations could wipe out my party in one hit - and visits to the Omega Dungeon were quickly met with the Game Over screen.

Why was my party so underpowered?

My RPG spidey-sense was underdeveloped. Barely hidden under the surface was a ton of endgame content. But I did have a nagging feeling ... Final Fantasy X and I had unfinished business.

The recent release of Final Fantasy X HD Remaster brought the memories flooding back along with an opportunity - it runs on a portable device - the PS Vita - opening up the possibility for play on the commute - pretty much my only chance for gaming nowadays.

Even better, the remaster also brings a bunch of trophies. A join-the-dots sequence of steps for completionists, clearly confirming that I had indeed missed out on my first expedition.

So the challenge is set! I need to correct a past wrong by obtaining every trophy in Final Fantasy X HD Remaster.

Let's do this!
