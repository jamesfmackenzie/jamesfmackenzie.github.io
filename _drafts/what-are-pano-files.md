If you're on the Windows platform, .pano files are probably the most convenient way to manage and share <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VR_photography" target="_blank">VR panoramas</a> (aka "360 photos").

### The Experience

Built-in support for .pano files is available in Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. Simply double click to open the photo viewer, then tilt, pan and zoom your way around the VR image.
